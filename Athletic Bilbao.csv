0,01/02/2021,14:47,"Messi fuels Barcelona revival, Marseille violence, Poch beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi kept up his improved form in La Liga as Barcelona won again amid more controversy about the Catalans' finances, while there was drama on and off the field in France and the Milan clubs continue to fight it out at the top of Serie A.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Barcelona have said they will take legal action against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after it published details at the weekend of Lionel Messi's current contract, which it says is worth up to 555 million euros ($674 million) over four years. El Mundo called it the ""colossal contract that ruins Barcelona"", just as the Catalans are wrestling with a dire financial situation, worsened by the pandemic, and with Messi's future currently up in the air. Yet the Argentine underlined his value to Barca by scoring a superb free-kick in their 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Barca are unbeaten in 10 n La Liga, winning eight, with Messi scoring eight times in that run. However, both Barcelona and Real Madrid are 10 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Cadiz 4-2 and still boast a game in hand. Marseille's weekend game against Rennes in Ligue 1 was postponed after angry supporters attacked the club's training ground, while the players were there, in what was called ""a frenzy of unjustifiable violence"". Local police said 25 arrests were made and seven officers were injured after several hundred Ultras stormed La Commanderie in a protest against the club leadership and the team's poor recent run of results. Marseille's owner, the American tycoon Frank McCourt, called the protestors ""thugs"" and likened the incidents to last month's storming of the US Congress. The growing crisis comes with the former Champions League winners having slumped to ninth in Ligue 1 and after coach Andre Villas-Boas indicated he will leave at the end of the season. On the pitch in France, the title race is hotting up after reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain suffered their first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino, conceding at the death to lose 3-2 at struggling Lorient despite Neymar scoring two penalties. It was a fifth defeat in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, who are third, three points behind leaders Lille. Lille beat Dijon 1-0, while Lyon are two points off top spot in second after scoring late to beat Bordeaux 2-1. It could even become a four-way fight. Monaco are six points off the lead after winning their last five games. Bayern Munich maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the German Bundesliga by beating Hoffenheim 4-1 as Robert Lewandowski scored his 24th goal of the league campaign. After a mini slump, the Bavarians have now four on the bounce and remain well clear of nearest rivals RB Leipzig. The result against Hoffenheim also allowed Hansi Flick's side to exact perfect revenge for their 4-1 defeat away to the same opponents in September, in what was their only loss in 46 matches in all competitions across a remarkable 2020. The only cloud on Bayern's weekend came as midfielder Corentin Tolisso was dropped and fined for getting a tattoo, therefore falling foul of Covid-19 quarantine regulations. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's spat with Romelu Lukaku dominated the headlines last midweek as Inter beat AC Milan in their Coppa Italia derby. On Saturday Ibrahimovic missed a penalty for the fourth time this season but Ante Rebic followed up to score and Franck Kessie later netted another spot-kick as Milan won 2-1 at Bologna. That result kept the Rossoneri two points clear of Inter at the top of Serie A, as Antonio Conte's side beat Benevento 4-0 with Lukaku scoring a brace at San Siro. The Belgian is on 14 league goals for the season and Inter remain best-placed to overhaul Milan, even if Roma, Juventus, Lazio and Napoli all also won at the weekend."
1,22/01/2021,11:06,Resistance to change leaves Madrid and Zidane pondering futures again,"Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane's week took a further turn for the worse on Friday as he tested positive for Covid-19, following on from an embarrassing loss in the Copa del Rey which has sparked fresh concerns about the club's present and future.","Madrid confirmed on Friday that Zidane had tested positive. He will miss his side's trip to Alaves in La Liga on Saturday as they seek a return to winning form following back-to-back Cup defeats. Humiliated by third-tier Alcoyano on Wednesday, a week after being outfought and largely outplayed in the Spanish Super Cup by Athletic Bilbao, Madrid find themselves in another slump. Their season might well finish without a trophy, with Atletico Madrid marching on in La Liga and Europe's elite stretching the gap even further away from Spain's once formidable trio in the Champions League. But more worrying is that this appears to be a squad in desperate need of renovation and a team shorn of the strengths that took them to the title only six months ago. The question is whether Zidane is the person for a rebuild, or even if he wants to be. Asked if he still has the backing of the players on Wednesday, Zidane said: ""I believe so, you have to ask them. We've done good things this season, apart from the last four games. Now we have La Liga and the Champions League and we have to work. ""Whether my message gets through, you have to ask them, I can't answer that."" Zidane's numerous successes have always been built on a solid defence, a dependable core and a relentless will to win that meant close games became narrow victories and pressure brought a reaction. The Frenchman, although he will have to watch from afar, needs another reaction now, starting at Mendizorrotza against Alaves. When his position came under scrutiny twice earlier his season, the team responded by winning the Clasico at Camp Nou in October, and later by rattling off six straight victories in December. The difference this time is not just the scale of the failure against Alcoyano -- who have not played in the top flight in 70 years -- but that it left Zidane accused of ignoring the future. His reliance on a select core was underlined by the poor performances of fringe players such as Isco, Marcelo and Eder Militao, who looked short of sharpness and, perhaps, motivation. Even more jarring for those higher up the club may have been the struggles of Vinicius Junior, Fede Valverde and Alvaro Odriozola, youngsters once circled as players who could be part of a new era. And what about those not there? Luka Jovic was sent back on loan to Eintracht Frankfurt and scored twice for them in 28 minutes. Or Martin Odegaard, who was recalled early from his loan at Real Sociedad only to be left searching this month for another exit. Sergio Reguilon is at Tottenham, Dani Ceballos at Arsenal. Zidane has decelerated the transition, perhaps because by relying on the old guard Real beat Barcelona to the league last term. When Zidane demanded change in summer 2019, his first transfer window after coming back, the club that failed to deliver. Eden Hazard, Jovic, Ferland Mendy, Militao and Rodrygo were signed for around 300 million euros but only Mendy at left-back has consistently improved the first team. Since then the pandemic has strangled the club financially, meaning there were no signings last year, and the price of failing to update grows ever more costly. Zidane has always been trusted to pull Madrid out of a mess but never to build something new. When they won the title last season, that papered over cracks, a testament to his ability to manage and motivate but the need for renewal remained. Zidane wanted change in exchange for coming back. The change the club is now pondering is their coach."
2,19/01/2021,15:25,Messi banned for two matches,Lionel Messi was banned for two matches on Tuesday following his first ever sending off for Barcelona.,"The Argentine forward was shown a red card at the end of Sunday's 3-2 extra-time defeat to Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup final after lashing out at Asier Villalibre. Messi had twice been sent off playing for Argentina, including at the 2019 Copa America, but never in 16 years and 753 matches with Barcelona's first team. The six time Ballon d'Or winner's ban was announced by the Spanish Football Federation with Barca later revealing their intention to appeal the sanction on their star player. Messi shook off a thigh problem to start in Seville and was required to play all 120 minutes as Barca attempted to take the game to penalties. Instead, the 33-year-old lost his temper at the end of a combative contest, reacting to a late challenge from Villalibre by swiping his hands across the back of his opponent. Messi was red-carded 15 years ago for Barca but it was with the reserves in a third division match, according to Spanish statistician Alexis Martin-Tamayo. Messi would miss games against third-tier Cornella away in the Copa del Rey on Thursday and Elche on Sunday in La Liga."
3,18/01/2021,13:46,"Messi sees red, 'fearful' Juventus, PSG back top: Talking points from around Europe","Frustration got the better of Lionel Messi as he saw red in the Spanish Super Cup final, while Inter dealt a major blow to Juventus's Serie A title hopes but Paris Saint-Germain are back on top in France.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi was sent off for the first time in 753 appearances for Barcelona at the end of his side's 3-2 extra-time defeat by Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup final in Seville, after lashing out at Asier Villalibre in a moment that seemed to encapsulate his recent frustration with his boyhood club. Messi had twice been shown a red card playing for Argentina, including at the 2019 Copa America, but never in more than 16 years with Barcelona, before Sunday. His dismissal came right at the end of extra time, after Athletic had scored a late equaliser to force the additional 30 minutes and then a stunning Inaki Williams strike gave the Basques a 3-2 win and their second Super Cup in six years. Barcelona had hoped to win their first trophy under Ronald Koeman and Messi had been in good form, with four goals in his club's previous two league games. ""Do I excuse him? I'd need to see it again,"" said Koeman of the incident. Andrea Pirlo's hopes of leading Juventus to a 10th straight Serie A title in his first season as a coach took a major knock as the reigning champions lost 2-0 away to Inter, one of the clubs he represented as a player. Arturo Vidal -- a former teammate of Pirlo's at Juve -- and Nicolo Barella scored the goals as Inter, coached by ex-Juventus boss Antonio Conte, moved level on points with leaders AC Milan, who have a game in hand to play on Monday. Juve, who had been on their best run of the season with three straight league wins, are now seven points off top spot. ""We couldn't have put in a worse performance than this,"" said Pirlo, who said his side were ""fearful"" and too defensive. They now play Napoli in the delayed Italian Super Cup on Wednesday. Paris Saint-Germain were without their new coach Mauricio Pochettino for their game at Angers after the Argentine tested positive for Covid-19. But, three days after winning his first trophy in management in the Champions Trophy against Marseille, he watched from afar as PSG ground out a 1-0 win that took them back to the top of Ligue 1. Layvin Kurzawa's goal made the difference, before former leaders Lyon saw their 16-game unbeaten run ended in dramatic fashion in a 1-0 home defeat against Metz. They were denied a late opener by a marginal offside call, and conceded in the 90th minute to Aaron Leya Iseka. Lyon are now third, two points off PSG who lead from Lille on goal difference. Lille beat Reims 2-1 with a last-minute Jonathan David winner. Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick was facing up to his first mini-crisis in charge as his side lost 3-2 at Borussia Moenchengladbach last weekend and then went out of the German Cup on penalties to second-tier Holstein Kiel. However they got back on track as Thomas Mueller's strike secured a 2-1 win over Freiburg on Sunday to move Bayern four points clear at the top of the Bundesliga from RB Leipzig, who drew 2-2 at Wolfsburg. With Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund slipping up as well, it seems doubtful that any of their rivals have the consistency needed to stop Bayern winning a ninth straight title, although there is still a long way to go. Benfica and Porto are Portugal's two most successful clubs and between them have won each of the last 18 league titles. On Friday they played out a 1-1 draw at the Estadio do Dragao, with Moussa Marega cancelling out Alex Grimaldo's opener before the Iranian Mehdi Taremi was sent off for Porto. It was a result that left the two teams level on 32 points from 14 games, and perhaps the big winners were Sporting. Looking for their first title since 2002, they stay four points clear and unbeaten, although they were held 1-1 at home by mid-table Rio Ave. Sporting are due to face Benfica later this month."
4,18/01/2021,00:38,Messi sees red as Bilbao stun Barca to win Spanish Super Cup,"Lionel Messi was sent off for the first time playing for Barcelona as Athletic Bilbao stunned the Catalans to win the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday, a dramatic final finishing 3-2 after extra-time.","Moments before Bilbao's momentous triumph was confirmed, Messi threw an arm at Asier Villalibre, who had earlier scored a 90th-minute equaliser in normal time to deny Barca victory. Antoine Griezmann's double looked to have sealed the trophy but Villalibre intervened before Inaki Williams' fabulous strike three minutes into extra time proved decisive. Messi shook off a thigh problem to start in Seville and was required to play all 120 minutes as Barcelona attempted to take the game to penalties. Instead, the 33-year-old lost his temper at the end of a combative contest, reacting to a late challenge from Villalibre by swiping his hands across the back of his opponent. It meant a first ever red card for Messi in 753 appearances for Barcelona, to go with his two reds for Argentina in 2005 and 2019. ""After so many years in football, Leo knows perfectly well when he is fit to play,"" said Barca coach Ronald Koeman. ""We talked and he said he was in a good place to start. He has survived the game, given the maximum, nothing more."" Messi's anger will take some of the limelight away from Bilbao, who had already denied the competition a Clasico final by beating Real Madrid in the semi on Thursday and now have completed the set. It means a title and the perfect start for Marcelino Garcia Toral, who only took over as coach less than two weeks ago. But there was praise too for his predecessor Gaizka Garitano, who oversaw this team reaching the Copa del Rey final last season, which earned qualification in the first place. ""This is for Gaizka Garitano and his coaching staff as well who brought us here,"" said Williams. Organisers at the Spanish Football Federation might have hoped for the global attraction of a Clasico, especially as the coronavirus pandemic had already kept the tournament in Spain rather than the lucrative Saudi Arabia, where it was played last year. Yet this was a frantic final, with a hugely surprising result. Barca arrived on the back of a nine-game unbeaten run and a trophy, even a minor one, would have turned encouraging signs in recent weeks into more tangible evidence of a revival under Koeman. ""It is not a step back,"" he said ""Always winning titles is helpful to show that we are on the right track, but it is only one game, it is a Super Cup, and we will show in the next few games that we are on the right track."" Bilbao were the better side in the first half, more decisive in possession and more aggressive out of it. But both teams created little for 40 minutes and then in two minutes both had scored. A brilliant pass created each of them, Messi the instigator for Barca. He collected from the right and threaded through for Jordi Alba on the left, whose cut-back was intended for the Argentinian but spilled out to Griezmann, who could not miss. Marcelino hurled his water bottle to the ground in disgust but his team were soon level. Williams played the pass, his clipped ball over the top catching Alba off-guard, with Oscar De Marcos sneaking in and half-volleying home. Raul Garcia thought he had his third goal in four days when he headed in just before the hour but Barca survived. With 10 minutes left, Griezmann struck again, Alba's cross evading the Bilbao defence and finding the Frenchman, who steered in at the front post for what looked like the winner. Instead, Bilbao scored in the 90th minute to send the game to extra-time and then the 93rd to lead for the first time. Villalibre was allowed to volley in from close range but there was little Barca could do about Williams' effort, the striker cutting inside from the left and whipping a tremendous shot into the top right-hand corner. Unai Nunez might have sealed it but failed to connect. Griezmann almost rescued it but fired high on the volley with his right foot. Then Villalibre left a shoulder in on Messi, who reacted, scuttling after his opponent and swinging an arm around the back of his head. Messi and Barca were beaten."
5,16/01/2021,18:47,Koeman hopeful on Messi fitness for Super Cup final,Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman says he is optimistic Lionel Messi will be fit for Sunday's Spanish Super Cup final against Athletic Bilbao after injury forced him to miss the semi-final.,"The Argentina forward was left out of the squad for Wednesday's penalty shootout victory over Real Sociedad after complaining of discomfort during last week's 4-0 La Liga win over Granada. ""He trained on his own yesterday (Friday). We have a session this evening, he wants to train, so we'll see how he feels afterwards and if he wants to play or not,"" Koeman told a news conference on Saturday in Seville. ""Tomorrow morning we'll see how his body reacts to the session, but we have high hopes that he'll be there for the match."" Messi was pictured with strapping on his left thigh as he watched the semi-final from the stands in Cordoba. Barca won 3-2 on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra time. ""Every player needs to be 100% to start the game, it's not the last game of the season, we still have a lot of games after this one,"" said Koeman. ""The final decision will be the player's."" Messi is the club's leading scorer this season with 14 goals in all competitions, his return to form of late coinciding with Barca's nine-game unbeaten run after a poor start under the Dutchman. ""It's always important to win things to prove that you are on the right track,"" said Koeman. ""It's not the most important title as a player but it's a title. ""Each title you win, it's another line on your list of honours. It's important for the players and for the club."""
6,14/01/2021,23:07,Bilbao to face Barca in Super Cup final after ousting Real Madrid,Real Madrid suffered a shock defeat in the Spanish Super Cup on Thursday as Athletic Bilbao pulled off a 2-1 victory in Malaga to reach Sunday's final against Barcelona.,"Raul Garcia scored twice in the first half, the second a penalty, and while Karim Benzema pulled one back for the defending champions, Bilbao held on to complete a statement win under their new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral. Bilbao were beaten 3-2 by Barca in La Liga only last week, with Lionel Messi scoring twice at San Mames, yet they will get another shot at Ronald Koeman's side this weekend, with a trophy up for grabs in Seville. ""We are 90 minutes from winning a title,"" said Marcelino. ""It would be amazing, and even better to do it beating Real Madrid and Barcelona."" Real coach Zinedine Zidane was defiant in defeat. ""It is not a failure,"" he said. ""You can't win every game."" Messi is touch and go to be fit for the final, after missing Wednesday's penalty shoot-out victory over Real Sociedad with a muscle problem, although even without their captain, Barcelona will be strong favourites. Bilbao, though, should take huge confidence from an excellent performance at La Rosaleda in what was only their second game under Marcelino, who replaced the sacked Gaizka Garitano earlier this month. They were also up against a Madrid team that had been unbeaten since December 1, even if a chaotic weekend caused by the heavy snowstorm in Spain might have had lasting effects on players' minds and bodies. Zidane insisted he was not making excuses on Saturday when he criticised the state of the snow-dusted pitch following the goalless draw at Osasuna. Cancelled flights meant Madrid's players were unable to leave Pamplona until Monday, forced to fly straight to Malaga without returning home. But even Zidane admitted on Wednesday that four days preparation was enough and there was little to suggest concern from his line-up given it was his full-strength team, the same core of players that has driven their resurgence since October. ""Our start to the game was difficult,"" said Zidane afterwards. ""The first half was not good. They had two chances and scored two goals. In the second part we changed the picture, we improved and created chances."" Raul Garcia was sent off after 13 minutes when Real Madrid beat Bilbao in the league last month but this time he had two goals in the first half, each coming after a mistake by Lucas Vazquez. First, Vazquez gave the ball away cheaply, allowing Raul Garcia to finish past Courtois and then Madrid's full-back dragged Inigo Martinez down at the back post after letting him sneak in behind him. Raul Garcia drove the penalty into the top corner and Bilbao might have been three up had Iker Muniain finished off a flowing move by heading in, instead of wide of the post. Madrid were better after the interval, with Marco Asensio lively. He hit the post from an Eden Hazard pull-back and then the crossbar with a swerving shot from distance. The pressure told when Fede Valderde's cross was nodded back for Benzema to tap in, leaving Madrid with just over 10 minutes to find an equaliser. Benzema thought he had it but the flag was up for offside before Sergio Ramos headed wide and Vinicius Junior curled over in a frantic late surge that Bilbao survived."
7,12/01/2021,16:26,Real Madrid defend Super Cup repatriated from Saudi to storm-hit Spain,"Despite the concerns about a crammed fixture calendar in a season badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, Spain is going ahead with its four-team Super Cup this week as Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao provide the opposition for Barcelona and Real Madrid.","However, after being taken to Saudi Arabia in January 2020, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) is organising this year's version in Andalusia, with the final on Sunday at La Cartuja in Seville. From the shores of the Red Sea back to Spain, which has been battered in recent days by Storm Filomena delivering the country's worst snowfall in decades as well as brutally cold temperatures. Barcelona play Real Sociedad in the first semi-final on Wednesday in Cordoba, before trophy holders Madrid face Athletic Bilbao in Malaga on Thursday, with the winners remaining in southern Spain to contest Sunday's final. All of the games will be behind closed doors. In ordinary times the RFEF would not have given up on its controversial money-spinning Saudi venture, after initially agreeing a 120 million-euro ($146m) three-year deal to play an expanded four-team competition in the Middle Eastern Kingdom. That agreement also included the option of three more years, but the lack of fans allowed in Saudi stadiums led the Federation to renegotiate its contract and bring the tournament back home. The move abroad followed in the footsteps of Italy and France, who have taken their own equivalents of the Super Cup -- between the previous season's league champions and domestic cup winners -- to foreign shores in recent years. This time the competition sees reigning La Liga champions Madrid and runners-up Barcelona joined by the two finalists from last season's Copa del Rey, an all-Basque final which was postponed due to the health crisis and has still not been played. That means current La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid are not involved, while Real will not go into their semi-final in the best shape after a build-up impacted by the winter storm. Zinedine Zidane's team were left stuck in the northern city of Pamplona for three nights due to the weather, leaving on Monday after drawing 0-0 with Osasuna on Saturday in a game which Zidane and his players felt should not have gone ahead. ""We are not puppets who should have to play all the time. We made the effort but we need to think about the travel involved too,"" complained goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Instead of returning to the capital, they flew straight to Malaga to prepare for the Super Cup. Athletic, meanwhile, had their game away to Atletico in Madrid postponed because of the snow -- their plane circled the sky awaiting permission to land before being forced to return home. Their hope is to be able to play their Basque neighbours in the final on Sunday before they eventually clash again in the delayed Copa del Rey showpiece. ""We are not used to winning trophies and it would be special and unforgettable,"" admitted their Spanish international centre-back Inigo Martinez. Before that game Barcelona will hope to continue their perfect start to 2021 against a Real Sociedad side who were top of La Liga but have won just one of their last nine league games. ""We are close to a first title of the season and we come into this full of excitement because we are on a good run,"" said Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets. Spanish Super Cup fixtures (2000 GMT)"

The fixture was scheduled for 1515 GMT at the Spanish league leaders' Wanda Metropolitano stadium. A new date for the encounter will be published in the coming days, LaLiga's statement added. Athletic were unable to land in Madrid because of the extreme weather brought by Storm Filomena on Friday and had to return to Bilbao early in the evening. The blizzards have caused chaos in Spain, with the capital's airport closed, hundreds of motorists stranded, and more snow forecast Saturday. Diego Simeone's Atletico lead the table by two points from city rivals Real with two games in hand."

Sociedad remain in third place in La Liga with 29 points, four behind Real Madrid who have a game in hand. Atletico Madrid still lead the way at the end of 2020 on 35 points, two ahead of their city rivals. Victory for Sociedad was also a boost with the two sides possibly facing each other in the Spanish Super Cup final in January. They will also meet in the delayed 2019/2020 Copa del Rey final in April. ""We were very clear about how we had to play and how we could harm them, they did not have any clear chances and we were able to kill the game,"" said Portu. ""By results I would say that it has been a very good year, but we have a bittersweet taste for all the fans who have not been able to enjoy our victories in 2020."""

Toni Kroos had given the hosts the lead in Madrid with a thumping strike on the stroke of half-time, but Ander Capa rocked the capital club six minutes after the break when he shot past Thibaut Courtois at the second time of asking. The 32-year-old Benzema had other ideas however, putting his team in front before making sure of the points in stoppage time with a clinical finish after collecting Luka Modric's pass. Third-placed Madrid gained their fourth straight win in all competitions and are equal on 26 points with Sociedad, who face troubled Barcelona at the Camp Nou on Wednesday, and local rivals Atletico Madrid. Tuesday's match was the game in hand which Real had on Sociedad, while Atletico have played two games fewer than their two title rivals. Barca are nine points back but play one of their two games in hand in the hope of giving some momentum to what has been a miserable season so far."
12,12/08/2020,18:09,Williams among six virus cases at Athletic Bilbao,Athletic Bilbao Forward Inaki Williams admitted on Wednesday that he was one of six positive coronavirus cases recorded at the La Liga club.,"Williams, 26, had returned to pre-season training with the Basque side this week ahead of the new La Liga campaign which begins in mid-September. ""Today it was confirmed that I tested positive after a PCR test. I'm asymptomatic and fortunately I'm doing well. I have to remain isolated now at home to beat the virus,"" Williams posted on Twitter. ""I can't wait for the moment to arrive so I can join the team for pre-season."" Williams' fellow squad members Oihan Sancet, Unai Lopez and Gaizka Larrazabal also said they were among those to have contracted COVID-19. Earlier in the day Bilbao said group training would stop and individuals who tested negative will be examined on Friday. Elsewhere, Barcelona announced Jean-Clair Todibo had caught the illness but that the defender had not been in contact with the squad travelling to Lisbon for Friday's Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich. On Tuesday, fellow La Liga clubs Valencia and Real Betis as well as second-tier Espanyol and Real Mallorca revealed they had squad members test positive. pve-gr/smr/iwd/td"
13,05/07/2020,16:34,Pin-point Ramos holds nerve again as Madrid beat Bilbao,Sergio Ramos scored his 22nd consecutive penalty on Sunday as Real Madrid held on for another 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao to inch closer to winning La Liga.,"Ramos' fifth goal in seven games since the restart gives Madrid a seven-point lead over Barcelona, who play later on Sunday at in-form Villarreal. Anything but a victory for Barca would probably leave them too much to do with four games remaining, especially as Madrid own the superior record head-to-head. This was Madrid's toughest fixture left and they might have been content even with a point against a robust, well-organised Bilbao side. But after edging out Getafe on Thursday, through a Ramos spot-kick, Madrid repeated the trick at San Mames, their captain's nerve from the spot combining with a gutsy display to grind out a pivotal win. Ramos was perhaps fortunate not to concede a penalty himself when, off the ball, he seemed to slip and tread on the foot of Raul Garcia, but Madrid escaped. Instead, the defender's 10th goal of the season, the best tally of his career, gave Madrid their third 1-0 win in a row, as well as a fourth consecutive clean sheet. ""It's a massive win,"" said Ramos. ""We knew today was going to be one of the biggest games that we have left. It's always a difficult game away at Bilbao and we saw it like that. We're happy with another crucial three points that put more pressure on Barcelona."" Ramos said he is always confident on penalties. ""In those moments of doubt that's when I feel most comfortable. I wanted to take the responsibility,"" he said. ""But if I wanted individual recognition I would play tennis."" Bilbao's Iker Munain said Madrid had again been lucky with decisions. ""We're not going to win it thanks to the referees,"" said Ramos. ""People have to look at themselves and be critical of their own performances. Based on the points, it seems we're doing well at the moment."" Madrid were without key players, with Raphael Varane nursing a neck injury and Eden Hazard out with pain in his ankle. Eder Militao replaced Varane while Marco Asensio made his first start in 14 months up front. There were chances at both ends in the first half and Bilbao had the best of them. Williams twice went close but was denied by a block by Marcelo and then a superb tackle by Militao while Raul Garcia's header was pushed out by Thibaut Courtois. Karim Benzema would have had a tap-in had Dani Carvajal executed a cushioned pass across the box but his touch was too high. Asensio's free-kick had created the chance and he swung in two more brilliant crosses before half-time, only for Rodrygo and Benzema to miss with their heads. The second half was tighter as both teams slowed in the heat and a more cautious contest seemed to suit Madrid, whose moment came in the 73rd minute. Marcelo was rewarded for a lung-busting run into the box, where he reached the ball just ahead of Dani Garcia, who twisted his body into the left-back and bundled him over. Referee Jose Gonzalez consulted VAR and awarded the penalty, which Ramos whipped into the bottom corner. Bilbao looked tired and never really threatened an equaliser but could have been gifted one had Ramos been penalised for the clumsy collision with Raul Garcia. Ramos survived and Madrid held on."
14,24/06/2020,01:01,Barcelona grind out Bilbao win to put pressure back on Madrid,"Barcelona limped to a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday that sends them back to the top of La Liga, for 24 hours at least, three points ahead of Real Madrid.","Only a goal from substitute Ivan Rakitic in the 71st minute prevented Barca from another stalemate after a draw at Sevilla on Friday had allowed Real to go top on head-to-head. Madrid will return to the summit if they beat struggling Real Mallorca on Wednesday but Barcelona's victory at least puts the pressure back on Zinedine Zidane's side, whose upward momentum is yet to be reflected by the table. This Barca performance though was hardly a statement of intent, devoid of chances, lacking zip and tinged with frustration rather than the free-flowing football Quique Setien was appointed to bring in. ""We knew it was going to be complicated,"" Setien said. ""Also because of the situation there is some anxiety because there's less and less margin for error. ""Sometimes we didn't play with that composure and that showed in the first half when were more inaccurate than usual. We gave some belief and confidence to Athletic."" Lionel Messi looked particularly wearied by his team's display. The Argentinian was creator-in-chief again but the dependence on him was high and he remains one away from the 700th goal of his career. Rakitic is likely to be among a handful of players allowed to leave this summer. He has not been a regular this season and this was his first Barca goal since the Clasico in March last year. ""It's a difficult period but we have to stick together,"" said Rakitic. ""It was an important goal, it was a tough game, it was hard for us to open the game up."" Arthur Melo started, despite reports he could be close to joining Juventus, and struggled. Sergio Busquets picked up a yellow card and will be suspended against Celta Vigo on Saturday but that should be a simpler assignment than the ones that come after against in-form Atletico Madrid and Villarreal. Athletic Bilbao stay 10th after suffering their first defeat since La Liga returned. They created the better chances in the first half. Inaki Williams, playing his 150th game in a row, darted in behind and Yeray Alvarez should have scored when free at the back post but missed from four yards. Messi cut a frustrated figure as he tried to create a spark but his efforts from distance, including one chip easily collected, hinted at desperation too. In the second half, Messi's lifted pass found Antoine Griezmann clear in the area but Unai Simon was quick to close the space and Griezmann failed to react. Griezmann's disappointing night came to an end when he was replaced by Ansu Fati, who headed over with his first touch. Riqui Puig also came on and it was the 20-year-old's pass that started the attack for the goal. Messi crossed to the back post and Arturo Vidal's header should have been cleared by Mikel Balenziaga. Instead, he gave it back to Messi, whose reverse pass was taken on by Rakitic, who bundled through and finished. Raul Garcia had an open net late on after Gerard Pique and Marc-Andre ter Stegen both evaded a cross but he failed to connect. Fati struck the post with a rebound in injury-time. Earlier, Atletico Madrid continued their surge towards Champions League qualification by winning 1-0 at Levante to climb to third, thanks to an early own goal by Bruno Gonzalez. Since matches restarted in Spain two weeks ago, Atletico have taken 10 points from a possible 12 and are now six points clear of fifth, as their top-four rivals have crumbled around them. One of them is Getafe, who continued their post-suspension slump as they were held to a 1-1 draw against struggling Real Valladolid. Getafe are fifth but without a win in the four games since La Liga resumed. Valladolid are 15th, seven points clear of the relegation zone. Levante stay 11th."
15,31/05/2020,13:25,Bilbao coach Garitano extends contract,"Athletic Bilbao coach Gaizka Garitano has extended his contract until June 2021, the Spanish club announced on Sunday.","Garitano took charge in December 2018 with the team in the relegation zone and led them to an eighth-place finish in his first season. They sit 10th in La Liga and beat Barcelona en route to the Copa del Rey final, to be played against Basque rivals Real Sociedad. Garitano's previous contract was due to expire this summer. ""The experience we have had this year in the cup has been magnificent and we have the opportunity to win a trophy,"" said Garitano. ""The team's objective in the final 11 games is clear. Despite the five-point gap behind Valencia, we want to qualify for Europe."" La Liga is set to restart on June 11 after a three-month absence due to the coronavirus pandemic."
16,20/05/2020,18:33,Hip replacement forces Bilbao hero Aduriz into retirement,Iconic Athletic Bilbao striker Aritz Aduriz announced on Wednesday that he has retired from professional football after revealing he needs a hip replacement.,"Aduriz, 39, will be forever remembered in Bilbao for four glorious goals he banged past Barcelona while winning the 2015-2016 Supercup, and even last season he scored the goal that saw the Basques beat the Catalan giants in la Liga. ""This is how the road ends for me -- unforgettable and marvellous, from beginning to end,"" Aduriz said of his many seasons at Bilbao. ""The doctors told me to go see the surgeon, sooner rather than later, to get a prosthetic to replace my hip and to try and go about my everyday life, as normally as possible. Unfortunately, my body has said 'enough'."" Aduriz topped the La Liga scoring charts twice, first with 18 goals in the 2014-15 season and then with 20 the following campaign. He was also twice Europa League top scorer, in 2015-16 with 10 goals and with eight -- joint with Lazio's Ciro Immobile -- two seasons later. After starting out at Bilbao in 2002 he moved on for spells at Burgos, Valladolid, Mallorca and Valencia before a return to Athletic in 2012."
17,04/05/2020,16:35,Spanish cup rivals want fans at the final,The Spanish Cup finalists Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao said on Monday that they had asked the Spanish football federation (RFEF) to ensure the final was played with fans in the ground.,"The clubs said in a joint press release that they had met with Luis Rubiales, the president of the RFEF, who had agreed to ask the general assembly on May 8, if the final could be played with open doors. This would be the first all-Basque final in the history of the competition. ""The desire and will of both clubs has always been, now and before, to play and enjoy the final match along with the supporters,"" they said in a joint English-language press release. ""This is what we would like most. A final to be lived with our supporters in the stands."" The match was originally scheduled for April 18 in Seville at the Olympic Stadium, known as La Cartuja. Announcing the postponement in March, Rubiales said: ""The aim is for La Cartuja to be full of people."" No new date has been fixed. The Spanish league remains suspended and clubs have not been able to return to training. Even so, the two Basque clubs said they wanted guarantees that ""the final will be played as an official competition and will, therefore, be considered an official title."" The governing body of European football (UEFA) has said that places in next season's continental club competitions will be awarded ""on sporting merit"", if domestic competitions cannot be completed. Real Sociedad, fourth in La Liga when play was suspended, would qualify for the Champions League. But, without a cup final, the last Spanish Europa League place would probably go to the team seventh in the table. Athletic, 10th in the standings, have said they are in ""deep disagreement"" with this solution. Bilbao won the inaugural Spanish cup in 1903 and have lifted the trophy 23 times, second only to Barcelona, but their last triumph was in 1984. Real Sociedad have won the Copa del Rey twice. Bilbao eliminated Barcelona in the quarterfinals while Real Sociedad put out Real Madrid. The clubs said that by sharing the final ""together with their fans, supporters, subscribers, members and partners"" they would be celebrating ""the true essence, and raison d'etre of this wonderful sport."""
18,16/04/2020,13:54,Bilbao become latest Spanish club to apply player pay cuts,Athletic Bilbao have joined Spain's leading clubs in implementing cuts to players' wages in a bid to limit the economic damage inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.,"Bilbao's announcement on Wednesday night means they become the latest La Liga team to take economic precautions after the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Sevilla were all forced to reduce their wage bills. ""The annual salary will drop by 17 per cent if the competition cannot resume and by 6 per cent if the season resumes behind closed doors,"" an Athletic Bilbao statement read. ""The players of the Athletic Bilbao men's first team, under the direction of their captains and in a gesture of responsibility and great commitment, agreed to voluntarily and significantly reduce their pay due to the circumstances which may affect the end of the 2019-20 season."" Before the season was halted in the middle of March due to COVID-19, Bilbao sat 10th in the table and were due to play in the final of the Copa del Rey against Basque rivals Real Sociedad, who have also announced pay cuts for their players. La Liga has identified three potential dates to resume the season, at the end of May, beginning of June or end of June. But any return is likely to involve fixtures being played behind closed doors for the foreseeable future. Spain has been one of the worst-hit countries by coronavirus, with the number of confirmed deaths surpassing 19,000 on Thursday."

""The Copa del Rey final has been postponed by mutual agreement with the finalist clubs to ensure that it will be played with spectators in the stands,"" RFEF president Luis Rubiales said in a statement. ""The aim is for La Cartuja to be full of people."" Bilbao president Aitor Elizegi and his Real Sociedad counterpart Jokin Aperribay had made clear they were opposed to playing the final in an empty stadium. Bilbao won the last of their 23 Spanish Cups in 1984. Their Basque rivals have not lifted the trophy since 1987. According to the Spanish press, one of the possible alternatives would be to play the final in Seville on May 30, a week after the end of the La Liga season and the same date as the Champions League final, but La Cartuja has been booked for a concert by Spanish heavy rock band Extremoduro. The semi-finals of the women's competition, the Copa de la Reina, between Athletic Bilbao and CDEF Logrono and Barcelona and Sevilla, have also been postponed ""until further notice"". On Tuesday, the RFEF ordered all matches in the top two divisions played behind closed doors. On Wednesday it also shut down all men's and women's outdoor and indoor competitions below the top two divisions."

However, he was the toast of the city Wednesday when he latched onto a cross from Inaki Williams just three minutes before the interval to score the game's only goal. Athletic coach Gaizka Garitano named the same team which shocked Barcelona in the quarter-finals last week and they will consider themselves unfortunate not to have won by a greater margin on Wednesday after having two strikes ruled out for offside. The second, scored off a fine volley in the 61st minute by Ander Capa, needed an intervention by VAR. ""To be honest, we don't have good feelings after this game. In the dressing room, no one is happy,"" said Garitano. ""When you are not happy because you have made mistakes, so be it. But we found it very difficult to create scoring chances."" Athletic Bilbao won the first Copa del Rey in 1930 with a 3-2 win over Real Madrid. With 23 titles, they are second on the all-time list to Barcelona who have triumphed 30 times.

22,07/02/2020,14:25,Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad kept apart in Copa semis,Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad were kept apart in the draw for the Copa del Rey semi-finals on Friday after the Basque rivals beat Barcelona and Real Madrid in the quarters.,"Bilbao will face Granada and La Real will take on Segunda side Mirandes over two legs, keeping alive the chance of a first Copa del Rey final between the Basque teams since 1910. Mirandes have reached the last four after knocking out three La Liga sides in Villarreal, Sevilla and Celta Vigo. But Real Sociedad will be strong favourites to end their fairytale run after they beat Real Madrid 4-3 in a seven-goal thriller at the Santiago Bernabeu on Thursday night. Bilbao then stunned Barcelona as Inaki Williams' 94th-minute header sent them through with a 1-0 win at San Mames. Granada, who sit 10th in La Liga, had already ended Valencia's hopes of retaining the title by winning 2-1 on Tuesday thanks to a Roberto Soldado double. The Copa del Rey's new format, which includes lower teams playing at home and single legs, has seen a string of upsets and left an unfamiliar quartet in sight of the trophy. Real Sociedad are the most recent winners of Spain's domestic cup, having lifted it in 1987. Bilbao last won the tournament in 1984. Granada's best is reaching the final in 1959 while this is only the second time Mirandes have made the semis in their history. The first legs are scheduled for February 12, with the return legs coming almost a month later on March 4."
23,03/01/2020,23:21,Sevilla slip again after draw against Bilbao,Sevilla gave Barcelona and Real Madrid the chance to pull further clear in La Liga's title race after they began the year by drawing 1-1 at home to Athletic Bilbao on Friday.,"Bilbao took an early lead through Ander Capa at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan and while an own-goal from Unai Nunez brought Sevilla level on the hour, the home side were unable to find a winner. It means Sevilla trail Real Madrid, who they play at the Santiago Bernabeu on January 18, by two points and Barcelona by four. Those gaps will grow on Saturday if Madrid win away at Getafe and Barcelona overcome local rivals Espanyol. With Atletico Madrid struggling for goals and Valencia still recovering after removing their coach, Sevilla have looked like the team most likely to challenge Spain's established duo. But after an encouraging run of form in October and November, Julen Lopetegui's side have managed only one win from their last four league matches. Qualification for the Champions League may soon be the best they can hope for, which would be no mean feat after they signed 13 players and sold 15 last summer, as well as hiring a new coach. Athletic Bilbao are in the hunt too. They sit seventh, three points behind fourth-placed Atletico Madrid, who play at home to Levante on Saturday. Gaizka Garitano's side took the lead in the 15th minute after an excellent control and finish from Capa, with Kenan Kodro finding the net again shortly after only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. Sevilla turned the screw in the second half. Jesus Navas, making his 500th appearance for Sevilla, almost set up an equaliser only for Luuk de Jong's finish from six yards to come back off the post. The home did level with half an hour left. Lucas Ocampos drove to the line and his cross was turned in by Nunez at the near post."
24,22/12/2019,23:56,Real Madrid lose ground in Spanish title race after stalemate,"Real Madrid were left to rue a series of near misses Sunday as they stumbled to a 0-0 home draw with Athletic Bilbao, dropping two points adrift of Barcelona in a tight Spanish title race.","Real also drew 0-0 in midweek at Barcelona but Sunday's result leaves Madrid on 37 points at the half-way stage of the season, two points off Barcelona who top the table on 39. Toni Kroos hit the bar, Karim Benzema saw an effort cleared off the line with a back-heel and both Rodrygo and Vincius Junior forced snap saves on a frustrating night for Madrid. Real defender Eder Militao was forced off after being poked in the eye and his replacement Nacho Fernandez also hit thje woodwork. Coach Zinedine Zidane brought on Gareth Bale and Luka Jovic, but Madrid failed to find a winner. ""It was neither bad luck nor complacency,"" Zidane said after the game. ""There's no reason to get depressed about this, we need to keep calm and keep our heads up."" ""We created lots of chances and if we keep going then they'll start going in. ""I feel sorry for the players. It would have been nice for them to get more; three points from three games isn't great."" For Bilbao, Kenan Kodro's thunderbolt shot was ruled out for off-side in the first half while the Santiago Bernabeu lived on its nerves when Athletic flooded forward deep into added time with Asier Villalibre almost clinching a winer at the death. Barcelona go into the brief Spanish winter break on top of La Liga after a glittering show led by Lionel Messi saw the defending champions beat Alaves 4-1 on Saturday. Messi hit his 50th goal of the year with Antoine Griezmann, Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal also on target. Sevilla are third on 34 points after their 2-0 win at Real Mallorca. Earlier Sunday Angel Correa came off the bench to score one and make another as Atletico Madrid climbed back into the top four with a 2-1 win at Real Betis. The red-and-white half of Madrid were in the doldrums after a home defeat to Barcelona a month ago but have since qualified for the Champions League last-16 where they can savour the chance of measuring themselves against Liverpool. European champions Liverpool travel to Madrid in February for the Champions League first leg match and will have noted the commitment inspired by Atletico's feisty Argentine coach Diego Simeone. ""Correa showed what he's made of today, we've been training him hard. He put on good pressure to get the first goal and a nice pass for the second,"" said Simeone. ""But I was just as pleased to see him fighting for the win right at the end, when the team needed him."" The goals all came after the break as second-half sub Correa came on for struggling France international Thomas Lemar on 56 minutes and scored with his first touch of the game to set Atletico on the road to a third straight win. Former Real Madrid, Juventus and Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata gave Atletico a 2-0 lead late on before a stoppage time consolation strike for the home fans came from Marc Bartra. It also ended five straight away draws for Atletico, who have managed just 20 goals in the first half of the season since they sold Griezmann to Barca in the summer."
25,08/08/2018,13:13,Bilbao's Kepa set to join Chelsea as Courtois replacement - reports,"Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is set to join Chelsea for 80 million euros (£71.6 million, $92.7 million), according to Spanish media reports on Tuesday.","The 23-year-old, who has been capped once by Spain, would be the most expensive goalkeeper in history and the replacement for Belgian Thibaut Courtois, who is expected to leave Stamford Bridge for Real Madrid. Sports daily Marca reported that Chelsea would meet the 80-million-euro release clause in Kepa's contract, beating the record transfer fee of 75 million euros which Liverpool paid Roma for Brazilian Alisson earlier in the close season. ""The British club have chosen Kepa as a replacement for Courtois, who in the next few hours will become a new Real Madrid player,"" wrote Marca. Marca's competitor AS said that ""negotiations are very close to closing"". ""If everything goes according to plan, Kepa will travel to London to be presented as a new Blues player on Wednesday or early Thursday."" Catalan newspaper Mundo Deportivo also reported that Kepa would be signing for Maurizio Sarri's Chelsea. British media also started to report the news later on Tuesday, with the BBC saying that Kepa was in ""advanced talks"" with the west London club. Kepa has played 53 times in La Liga for Bilbao over the last two seasons, and made his international debut in a 5-0 friendly win over Costa Rica in November 2017. He was also in the Spain squad for the recent World Cup in Russia as back-up to David De Gea, but did not get any playing time. Meanwhile, Spanish media have also claimed that Chelsea could be set to bring in midfielder Mateo Kovacic on loan from Real Madrid after his efforts in helping Croatia reach the World Cup final. Manager Sarri's first serious test on the pitch since taking over from Antonio Conte will be a season-opening trip to Huddersfield in the Premier League on Saturday. The 59-year-old Italian started his reign with a 2-0 loss to reigning English champions Manchester City last weekend in the Community Shield. Chelsea are hoping to recover after a disappointing Premier League title defence last season saw them finish fifth and fail to qualify for the Champions League."
26,18/03/2018,18:20,Messi shines again as dominant Barca down Athletic,Lionel Messi delivered another masterful performance as Barcelona sailed past Athletic Bilbao 2-0 on Sunday to take an 11-point lead over nearest rivals Atletico Madrid in La Liga.,"After putting Chelsea to the sword in the Champions League midweek, Messi scored for the sixth game in a row against Athletic at the Camp Nou to propel Barca closer to the domestic title. A dominant start from Barca yielded the opening goal after just eight minutes as Messi found Jordi Alba out on the left, his pull back neatly side-footed into the far corner by Paco Alcacer, filling in for the suspended Luis Suarez. The hosts looked a constant threat early on and Philippe Coutinho was denied a second when he rattled the woodwork, while Ousmane Dembele should have done much better with just Kepa Arrizabalaga to beat. But the Athletic goalkeeper was powerless to keep out a crunching low drive from Messi on the half hour, the Argentine taking a touch to control a pass from Dembele before lashing home. Coutinho, the club's record signing, struck the woodwork for a second time as he tried to lob Kepa after latching onto a clever lofted pass from Paulinho, who then smacked a curling shot of his own against the upright. Barca remain unbeaten in La Liga with nine games of the season remaining, although second-placed Atletico can reduce the gap at the top when they visit Villarreal later on Sunday. Zinedine Zidane's Real can reclaim third place from Valencia, who were 3-1 winners over Alaves on Saturday, with Girona making the trip to the Spanish capital for a 1945 GMT kick-off. Earlier, Sevilla crashed to a 2-1 league defeat to Leganes just days after pulling off the surprise elimination of Manchester United in the Champions League. The loss means Sevilla are increasingly unlikely to qualify for the Champions League through La Liga this season. Unai Bustinza put Leganes ahead four minutes before half-time with a superb header in their Butarque stadium in the Madrid suburbs. Javi Eraso doubled the lead in the 69th minute. Mexican international Miguel Layun pulled a goal back for Sevilla in the 90th minute when he was fed by the scorer of both goals in the triumph at Old Trafford, French striker Wissam Ben Yedder. Sevilla face a torrid few weeks with leaders Barcelona next up in La Liga on March 31 before they host Bayern Munich on April 3 in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-finals. bur-mw/pb <org>MANCHESTER UNITED</org>"

They head to Old Trafford after being held to a goalless draw in the first leg. Vincenzo Montella's side face a fight, however, to qualify for the competition again next season, their victory over Bilbao closing the gap behind fourth-placed Valencia to five points. Valencia host Real Betis on Sunday. Elsewhere, Villarreal's ambitions of securing European football next season also took a knock as they were beaten 2-0 at home to Girona. Girona sit seventh, but now just one point behind their opponents, who were undone by goals from Christian Stuani and substitute Anthony Lozano."

Atletico Madrid and French striker Antoine Griezmann were paired with Lokomotiv Moscow, the day after another Spanish-Russian game, between Athletic Bilbao and Spartak Moscow, was marred by violence in which a Spanish policeman died of a heart attack. Bilbao will face 1993 European champions Marseille for the matches on March 8 and 15. Another French side, Lyon, must overcome CSKA Moscow to keep alive their hopes of appearing in the final which will be played at their own stadium on May 16. Lyon were comfortable 4-1 aggregate winners over Villarreal in the round of 32 and former club stalwart Bernard Lacombe welcomed the draw which sees the second leg played in France. ""We qualified well against Villarreal, who are a good club. Obviously it would be fantastic to play in our own stadium (in the final) but there are high-level opponents left in the competition and we have to respect that,"" he told beIN Sports. RB Leipzig, who dropped into the competition after being eliminated from the Champions League, will play Zenit Saint-Petersburg, who won the Europa League in 2008. Borussia Dortmund meanwhile face potentially the weakest team in the last 16, Czech side Plzen."

The officer was one of over 500 police officers deployed to the San Mames stadium in Bilbao for the high-risk return leg of the tie. He ""suddenly felt ill during the serious incidents... despite being taken quickly to hospital, he suffered cardiac arrest,"" the Basque government's security department said in a statement, adding hia death was not ""directly"" linked to an injury he suffered in the clashes. The trouble began as Spartak 'ultras' arrived at the stadium. Some lit and threw smoke bombs and garbage cans towards Athletic supporters, before police charged them. Police detained five Spaniards, three Russians and a Polish man over the clashes, a spokesman for the Basque security department said. They face charges of causing a public disorder, rioting and disrespect for authority. Five police officers were injured, none of them seriously, and treated on the scene, the spokeswoman added. There was concern ahead of the match because of the reported presence of hardcore Russian fans in Bilbao, and police seized knives, bags full of rocks and brass knuckles from supporters of the two teams, the Basque security department said. Earlier Thursday, German police arrested a Russian suspected of the ""attempted murder"" of a British football fan during the European Championship in France two years ago. He was detained at Munich airport as he was trying to travel to Bilbao to attend the match, according to German police. But a spokesman for Russia's embassy in Germany, Denis Mikerine, ""strongly protested"" the arrest on Facebook, saying it was a ""possible pretext"" to ""politicise the theme of football hooliganism before the 2018 World Cup in Russia"". Russian authorities will be on high alert this summer for the World Cup after Russian fans were involved in pitched battles with England supporters in Marseille during Euro 2016. FIFA said Friday it ""deeply regrets"" the clashes in Bilbao but had ""complete trust"" in Russia's ability to ensure a safe World Cup. Spartak won Thursday's match 2-1, but Bilbao went through 4-3 on aggregate."

However, he refused to comment on Spanish media speculation that he had died as a result of the fighting which took place before the game. He added that an autopsy would have to be performed before they were in a position to comment on the cause of death.

Having cruised to a 3-0 victory in the first leg last week, Arsene Wenger's Arsenal appeared complacent and were caught out by the vibrant visitors to the Emirates. Midfielder Hosam Aiesh capped off a slick move for the underdogs to pull one back in the 22nd minute, running onto Saman Ghoddos' through ball and slotting into the corner with the aid of a deflection off Calum Chambers. The hapless Arsenal centre-back was caught out just 69 seconds later as the home fans were left stunned, with winger Ken Sema spinning Chambers and drilling a low finish past Gunners goalkeeper David Ospina. Potter may have been thinking back to his side's missed injury-time penalty in the first-leg 3-0 loss, but they continued to press as Arsenal laboured. The Premier League side made it to half-time with a 3-2 aggregate lead intact, but were booed off the field by their own supporters. Unsurprisingly, Wenger's men were much-improved after the break and left-back Kolasinac capitalised on uncertainty in the Ostersunds defence to hammer home with his weaker right foot. But instead of building on that goal, Arsenal continued to be largely outplayed by their unheralded opposition, with Ghoddos and Curtis Edwards both going close to restoring the two-goal cushion. The Swedes ran out of legs as their continental adventure came to an end with a famous victory, but Arsenal were left facing plenty of questions ahead of Sunday's League Cup final against Manchester City. ""We were nowhere near it and not good enough,"" said Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere. ""We are through and that is all that counts. We will see who we get tomorrow and refocus on the big game on Sunday."" Marcel Schmelzer's late equaliser saw Borussia Dortmund grab a 1-1 draw at Atalanta to edge into the next round. Michy Batshuayi's double had brought Dortmund back from 2-1 down to win last week's home game 3-2, and Schmelzer struck seven minutes from time on Thursday to keep the German side in Europe. Belgian striker Batshuayi accused Atalanta fans of racist abuse after the game, writing on Twitter: ""2018 and still racists monkey noises in the stands... really? hope you have fun watching the rest of @EuropaLeague on TV while we are through... #SayNoToRacism. #GoWatchBlackPanther."" Serie A leaders Napoli gave RB Leipzig a serious fright in Germany, but a 2-0 win was in vain as last week's 3-1 loss proved too much to come back from. Leipzig held on to continue their debut European campaign with Napoli left to focus on defending their one-point lead over Juventus in Italy."
32,18/02/2018,22:52,"Real Madrid win eight-goal thriller, Atletico keep up Barca chase",Man of the moment Marco Asensio scored twice and Cristiano Ronaldo was also on target as Real Madrid kept up the feel-good factor with a thrilling 5-3 victory at Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday night.,"Madrid had been 2-1 down at half-time in a fantastic game at the Benito Villamarin, but they came roaring back in the second half with Sergio Ramos, Asensio -- who had scored the opener - Ronaldo and Karim Benzema all finding the net. They survived a late Betis onslaught, and after their 3-1 Champions League last 16, first-leg win against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, this victory confirms that Zinedine Zidane's side are looking better in La Liga now too. They remain fourth, a huge 17 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, this was their fourth win in five league outings, and they are back to within a point of third-placed Valencia with a game in hand to come at Leganes in midweek. Asensio had come off the bench to set up the two late goals that allowed Real to beat PSG and he was rewarded with a start on Sunday in Seville, while Gareth Bale also came in as the likes of Benzema and Luka Modric dropped to the bench. Asensio duly headed Madrid into an 11th-minute lead after Antonio Adan had saved a Ronaldo shot, but Betis had won when the sides last met at the Santiago Bernabeu and they hit back brilliantly. Loren and Joaquin, the latter from a free-kick, both came close before Aissa Mandi headed in a Joaquin cross to make it 1-1 in the 33rd minute. It was 2-1 shortly after, as visiting defender Nacho could only help a Junior shot into his own net, and the home fans in the crowd of over 53,000 erupted. Real also saw Marcelo limp off in the first half -- a potentially worrying sign ahead of the PSG second leg -- but they recovered superbly after the restart. Ramos, whose Sevilla past always ensures a hot reception from the Betis fans, levelled with a bullet header from a Lucas Vazquez corner. Dani Carvajal then set up Asensio for his second and Real's third as the hour approached, and Ronaldo smashed in their fourth goal in the 65th minute. The Portuguese, supposedly in decline, has now scored 10 times in six games between league and Champions League. Betis may lack the consistency to properly contest a European place, but they do provide entertainment, and Cristian Tello set up fellow substitute Sergio Leon to make it 4-3 late on. Benzema, on from the bench, completed the scoring at the death with a goal that will boost his confidence. Earlier, Kevin Gameiro came off the bench in the second half to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as second-placed Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0. It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League trip to Chelsea. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Villarreal are sixth after a 1-1 draw at Espanyol, while Real Sociedad beat Levante 3-0."
33,18/02/2018,18:24,"Gameiro, Costa on target as Atletico keep up Barcelona chase",Kevin Gameiro came off the bench to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in La Liga on Sunday.,"It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without their mean defence conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten league leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League last 16, first leg away to Chelsea. Former Chelsea striker Costa returned for Atletico at the Wanda Metropolitano after injury prevented him from taking part in their 4-1 Europa League win over FC Copenhagen in Denmark on Thursday. Atletico created little in the first half to get the crowd of just over 60,000 out of their seats. However, they livened up after the restart, and in particular after Gameiro was sent on for Koke just before the hour mark. It was Atletico's French connection that led to the opening goal midway through the second half, with Antoine Griezmann setting up Gameiro, who took a touch before firing low past Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the far corner for his fifth league goal of the season. Gameiro then turned provider with a fine through ball for Costa, who fired home to secure the points with 10 minutes remaining, the goal his second in La Liga since returning to Spain. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona at the top of the table. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Simeone's side are also nine points clear of third-placed Valencia, who came from behind to win 2-1 at bottom club Malaga on Saturday. Real Madrid, in fourth, are at Betis on Sunday evening. Earlier on Sunday, Real Sociedad beat struggling Levante 3-0 at Anoeta."
34,30/01/2018,19:13,"Man City seal Laporte deal, Aubameyang arrives at Arsenal","Manchester City completed the signing of Aymeric Laporte on Tuesday as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang reportedly arrived at Arsenal's training ground to finalise his transfer from Borussia Dortmund, with clubs scrambling to beat Wednesday's deadline.","Premier League leaders City are reported to have paid a club record £57 million ($80 million, 65 million euros) for Athletic Bilbao defender Laporte, eclipsing the £55 million they paid for Kevin De Bruyne in 2015. The 23-year-old is also the second most expensive defender in history behind Virgil van Dijk, who cost Liverpool £75 million from Southampton earlier this month. Last week, Alexis Sanchez signed for Manchester United from Arsenal in a swap deal with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and with the clock ticking, it appears Arsene Wenger will land Aubameyang to boost his forward options. ""I am very happy to be here,"" Laporte said in a statement on Manchester City's website. ""City are a club with a lot of ambition and they are one of the best teams in Europe. ""I am looking forward to working under Pep Guardiola and trying to help the club to achieve success."" City boss Guardiola said Laporte was ready to play straight away but may need time to adapt to the Premier League. ""He's fit, he's been playing the last period,"" Guardiola told reporters. ""Of course he has to adapt because the Premier League is special in many senses. ""He is intelligent, he will read what is the situation. Even for English players, when they come into the Premier League it's always a little bit tough. We will be patient because he doesn't come for three months, he comes for five years."" Guardiola has now spent more than £200 million on reinforcing his defence, bringing in Laporte alongside Benjamin Mendy (£52m), John Stones (£47.5m) and Kyle Walker (£45m). A France international at all youth levels, Laporte has been frustrated at continually being overlooked by senior team coach Didier Deschamps. Guardiola's January spending might not be over after widespread reports that City are interested in Leicester winger Riyad Mahrez. Mahrez, 26, is reported to have handed in a transfer request as the Algerian tries to force through a move to Eastlands. But City, looking for an attacker to cover for the injured Leroy Sane, may have to offer in excess of £50 million to seal the deal. Sky Sports News reported later Tuesday that Aubameyang, 28, had arrived in Britain on a private jet before travelling to Arsenal's training ground near London. Arsenal are understood to have agreed a fee of around £60 million with the Bundesliga club for the Gabon international but the German club will reportedly only sanction the move if they find a replacement. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud is reportedly a key cog in the transfer -- either as a direct replacement for Aubameyang or as part of a three-way deal, with Giroud moving to Chelsea and Michy Batshuayi swapping Stamford Bridge for Dortmund. Reports in Italy suggest a Chelsea bid for Roma's former Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko has been unsuccessful. Chelsea boss Antonio Conte refused to confirm speculation that the club are set to complete a deal for Roma defender Emerson Palmieri. He admitted recruiting defensive cover was a priority but would not reveal whether a transfer was likely and suggested a youth player could be introduced to the first team instead. Elsewhere, Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge, 28, left Anfield for struggling West Brom on a loan deal until the end of the season after slipping down the pecking order under Jurgen Klopp. Barcelona winger Gerard Deulofeu has become Javi Gracia's first signing as Watford manager after arriving at Vicarage Road on loan until the end of the campaign. Celtic have signed Chelsea midfielder Charly Musonda on an 18-month loan deal, with left-back Baba Rahman departing Stamford Bridge for Schalke in a similar arrangement."

The 23-year-old Frenchman is Guardiola's sixth signing of the 2017/18 season and has joined in a deal until 2023. ""I am very happy to be here,"" Laporte said. ""City are a club with a lot of ambition and they are one of the best teams in Europe. ""I am looking forward to working under Pep Guardiola and trying to help the club to achieve success."" Txiki Begiristain, City's director of football, said: ""We are delighted to have signed Aymeric. We have assessed defensive options and he is a player we have admired for a long time. ""With his quality and ability to play out from the back, we feel Aymeric will fit in perfectly with Pep Guardiola's playing style."""

The player's registration could be delayed until early next week because Spain celebrates Epiphany with a national holiday on Saturday and the league offices will be closed. Real's next match is in the Copa del Rey against Numancia at the Bernebeu next Wednesday. The young Basque is slender and agile, stands 6ft 3in (1.94m) tall and weighs 84 kilos. He came through the Bilbao youth system, made his league debut in 2016 and has played 38 times for the club but his contract is due to expire in June and he had refused to sign a new one. He was part of the Spanish team that won the European under-19 Championship in 2012 and made his first appearance for the senior national team in November, playing 90 minutes in a 5-0 friendly win over Costa Rica. Kepa's arrival could push Kiko Casilla, the usual backup to Keylor Navas, toward the exit."
40,01/12/2017,11:03,Five things to look out for in La Liga,Barcelona look to extend their four-point lead at the top of La Liga against an old friend turned foe in Celta Vigo coach Juan Carlos Unzue on Saturday.,"Meanwhile, Real Madrid travel to a struggling Athletic Bilbao with their eyes firmly on one of Athletic's rising stars. Here, AFP Sport looks at five things to look out for in La Liga this weekend. Gareth Bale's emergence off the bench to save a faltering young Real side from embarrassment against third-tier Fuenlabrada in the Copa del Rey earned the Welshman rave reviews in the Spanish press on Wednesday. Marca declared Bale had been handed a ""fresh start"" after a year dogged by a series of injuries. Yet, he could be absent again at San Mames due to a niggling calf problem having missed training for the past two days. Unlike Bale, Keylor Navas didn't help Madrid on his return to action after six weeks out by turning Fuenlabrada's opener into his own net in midweek. Kiko Casilla was also at fault for Malaga's second goal at the Bernabeu last weekend, intensifying Real's search for a new goalkeeper. According to reports, the new man will be Athletic's Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has been one of few shining lights in a hugely disappointing season for Bilbao. Arrizabalaga didn't feature as the Basques did suffer Cup humiliation at the hands of tiny islanders Formentera on Wednesday, edging coach Jose Angel Ziganda closer to the sack. Unzue returns to the Camp Nou hoping to continue Celta's record of beating Barca once in each of the three previous seasons when he was assistant to Luis Enrique. Celta's daring approach against the Catalans in recent years has though had mixed success. Whilst they have twice hit Barca for four at home, in their last two visits to the Catalan capital Celta have been smashed 6-1 and 5-0. Las Palmas are looking for already their third coach of the season after Pako Ayestaran was sacked on Thursday. Ayestaran was only appointed in September when Manuel Marquez resigned. How the Islanders must wish they had held on to the man they will face this weekend back when Quique Setien brings Real Betis to the Canary Islands. Setien not only kept Las Palmas up in the previous two seasons, but did so thanks to some thrilling attacking football. That has continued at Betis, whose 13 La Liga games this season have produced 50 goals. However, contractual differences with the board saw Setien walk out in the summer and left Las Palmas in the lurch. Valencia kept their unlikely title challenge alive by holding Barca at home last weekend. That point came at a cost, thought, as PSG loanee Goncalo Guedes suffered a broken toe that is expected to keep the Portuguese winger out for the rest of the year. Guedes's three goals and five assists have played a huge part in Valencia's revival. However, a kind fixture list during Guedes's absence offers Valencia hope with a visit to Getafe on Sunday followed by Celta, Eibar and Villarreal before the winter break."
41,15/11/2017,12:37,Bilbao veteran Aduriz signs on until 2019,"Veteran striker Aritz Aduriz, 36, has signed a one-year contract extension that will see him stay at Athletic Bilbao until 2019, the La Liga club announced Wednesday.","The buyout clause for the 13-times capped Spain international remains 40 millon euros ($47.3m). Aduriz has already scored nine goals this season, four in La Liga and five in the Europa League."
42,28/10/2017,23:24,Messi maintains under-par Barca's lead over resurgent Valencia,Barcelona recorded their best ever start to a La Liga season as coach Ernesto Valverde enjoyed a successful return to Athletic Bilbao thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Paulinho in a 2-0 win on Saturday.,"Valverde has now overseen 12 wins and a draw from his first 13 La Liga and Champions League matches as Barca reestablished their four-point lead at the top of the table over Valencia, who beat Alaves 2-1 earlier on Saturday. The Catalan giants also move eight points clear of rivals Real Madrid, who are in action on Sunday amidst a backdrop of political turmoil as they travel to Catalonia to take on Girona. ""The truth is we struggled a lot, especially in the second-half,"" Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets told Movistar TV. ""They had chances to equalise, but with a counter-attack at the end we scored the second which leaves us with this spectacular start."" Valverde left Bilbao in the summer and his impact has been felt just as much in Bilbao as it has in Barcelona -- Athletic have now one just one of their last 12 matches in all competitions. ""Athletic pressed us hard in the second-half and made it difficult,"" said Valverde. ""We gave the ball away a number of times and, without creating too many clear-cut chances, Athletic are always a threat when the ball is bouncing around the area."" The hosts started the brighter and only a stunning save from Marc-Andre ter Stegen prevented Aritz Aduriz from slotting Athletic in front on 19 minutes. Barca, and Messi in particular, grew into the game as the half wore on and the Argentine should have opened the scoring when he hit the woodwork for already the 10th time this season with the goal at his mercy from Luis Suarez's pass. Messi was at the heart of another flowing team move to break the deadlock eight minutes before half-time. He exchanged one-twos with Paulinho and Jordi Alba before sweeping home the left-back's low cross. Paulinho should have extended the visitors' advantage when he smacked the crossbar moments later, but an under-par Barca had to withstand plenty of Athletic pressure after the break. Raul Garcia's header also hit the woodwork, while Ter Stegen produced another stunning stop from Aduriz five minutes from time. But Barca held out to record a ninth clean sheet in their last 13 games, and added a second deep into stoppage time when Paulinho tapped home the rebound after Kepa Arrizabalaga had parried Suarez's first effort. After two seasons in the doldrums, Valencia's stunning revival under Marcelino Garcia Toral continued as they remain Barca's closest challengers with victory in Vitoria. Simone Zaza blasted Valencia into the lead 10 minutes before half-time from Manchester United loanee Andreas Pereira's cut-back for his ninth goal of the season. Alaves levelled through Alexis's header early in the second period, but Rodrigo's penalty after Rodrigo Ely handled a cross inside his own box gifted the visitors all three points. ""It has completely changed, not just our level of play but also our mentality,"" Zaza said of Valencia's upturn in form since Marcelino took charge in June. ""The coach has helped a lot in that. Now we are competitive and can compete against anyone. ""We are second and we have to enjoy it. We don't know how far we can go, but we have a lot of ambition."" Atletico Madrid remain fourth, level on 20 points with Real Madrid, but their stumbling season continued as they were held 1-1 at home by Villarreal for their fifth draw in 10 Liga games. Diego Simeone's men's problem has largely been finding the net but they went in front just after the hour mark in spectacular fashion as Angel Correa cushioned Antoine Griezmann's volleyed pass into his path before slotting home at the near post. However, in another recurring theme of Atletico's season, they sat far too deep in trying to defend their lead and were punished nine minutes from time when Carlos Bacca flicked home a header from a corner. ""If the team continues with that aggression and intensity, better times will come,"" insisted a defiant Simeone, whose side face a must-win Champions League clash against Qarabag of Azerbaijan on Tuesday."
43,20/09/2017,21:58,"Griezmann, Oblak star as Atletico beat Athletic Bilbao",Atletico Madrid celebrated being awarded the honour of hosting the Champions League final in 2019 with an impressive 2-1 win at Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday to move up to second in La Liga.,"Angel Correa opened the scoring 10 minutes into the second-half by finishing off a flowing move involving Antoine Griezmann and Saul Niguez. And Yannick Carrasco secured the three points with an angled finish from another Griezmann through ball 17 minutes from time before Raul Garcia netted a late consolation for the hosts. Atletico closed to within four points of leaders Barcelona, but could be surpassed by Sevilla and Real Madrid who host Las Palmas and Real Betis respectively later on Wednesday. UEFA awarded their showpiece event for next season to Atletico's new Wanda Metropolitano earlier in the day. And the feel-good factor around Atletico following their 1-0 victory over Malaga to open their new 68,000 capacity home at the weekend continued with a commanding display in their fifth away trip in six games so far this season. The visitors needed to rely on a brilliant penalty save from Jan Oblak to go in level at half-time. The Slovenian stopper leapt low to his right to deny Aritz Aduriz after Filipe Luis had been extremely harshly penalised for a challenge on Garcia outside the box. At the other end Atletico had the killer touch they lacked in stalemates at Valencia and Roma in their Champions League opener last week. Correa was left with the simplest of finishes to roll into an empty net after Saul unselfishly squared from Griezmann's through ball to open the scoring. Griezmann then had a goal ruled out for offside and strong penalty appeals himself waived away. But despite failing to get on the scoresheet, the French international was decisive with another killer pass for substitute Carrasco to fire just inside the far corner. Oblak made another fine save to deny Iker Muniain, although the Slovenian was finally beaten when Garcia scored against his former side in stoppage time."
44,05/08/2017,20:26,Liverpool down Bilbao to cap impressive pre-season,Liverpool ended their globetrotting pre-season unbeaten after easing to a 3-1 win over Spanish side Athletic Bilbao at Lansdowne Road in Dublin on Saturday.,"Jurgen Klopp's side warmed up for next Saturday's Premier League opener at Watford with an emphatic friendly victory, leaving them unbeaten inside 90 minutes over eight games that included a 3-0 win over German champions Bayern Munich. The Reds went into an early lead through Roberto Firmino, before Inaki Williams levelled before half time. Klopp made 10 changes at the break, and teenage duo Ben Woodburn and Dominic Solanke added two more goals to seal victory. The Premier League side were up against a weakened opposition, with the Spaniards making 11 changes to the side that beat Dinamo Bucharest in the Europa League on Thursday. Liverpool were without the injured Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho, a possible transfer target for Barcelona, and Adam Lallana, but still fielded a strong team. Belgium striker Divock Origi should have had the Reds ahead inside 10 minutes when Joel Matip delivered a perfectly weighted slide pass to put him through on goal. But the striker pulled his attempt wide, and after Alberto Moreno and Mohamed Salah combined to set him up again five minutes later, the 22-year-old headed wide again. The opening goal didn't take long to come, with Firmino, who scored twice from the spot in midweek against Atletico Madrid, doing so once more after Inigo Lekue conceded a soft penalty by grappling with the Brazilian. Bilbao were threatening on the counter attack against a rocky Liverpool defence, with Inaki Williams setting up Ager Aketxe, but stretching to connect his shot went wide of Simon Mignolet's goal. Williams reacted with frustration but made up for it moments later when he blocked Dejan Lovren's attempted clearance and placed a controlled finish past Mignolet to level the score. Firmino put Moreno through on Kepa Arrizabalaga just before the break but the full back, who had been impressive in attack, fired right at the goalkeeper. Bilbao forward Cordoba who had the first shot on target after the break, unfortunately for him it was right at Mignolet. Sadio Mane's close range strike was then pushed over by Arrizabalaga, but the keeper could do nothing about Woodburn's goal just before the hour. Solanke raced behind his opposition full back and pulled back for the 17 year old, who took one touch before rifling past Arrizabalaga to regain the lead for the Reds. Ragnar Klavan returned the favour to Solanke with 10 minutes to go, chipping an inch perfect cross for the England U20 man to head home."

48,10/08/2016,13:31,Dortmund suffer Bilbao defeat in Bayern warm-up,Borussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel admitted there was 'room for improvement' after his team lost 1-0 to Athletic Bilbao in their German Super Cup warm-up before facing Bayern Munich.,"Bundesliga champions Bayern, under new head coach Carlo Ancelotti, are Dortmund's next opponents at Signal Iduna Park on Sunday for the German Super Cup in the traditional pre-season opener. But Tuchel's experimental 4-1-4-1 formation failed to break the Bilbao defence, despite fielding an attack boasting Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Japan's Shinji Kagawa, plus new signings, Germany forwards Mario Goetze and Andre Schuerrle. ""There is a lot of room for improvement, when we analyse the game, we'd do well not to expect too much for Sunday,"" admitted Tuchel after Tuesday's defeat in St Gallen, Switzerland. ""We were very tired and didn't manage to put into effect the things we have planned. ""I have the feeling that although we want to, we are not in a position to put in a top performance after an intense training camp. ""There is no question we can do better."" Dortmund put out a statement after the Bilbao defeat to say Germany winger Marco Reus is on course to return to training in mid-August from the groin injury which ruled him out of Euro 2016. Tuchel had said that timeframe was ""impossible"" and that he would be ""extremely surprised"" if Reus can train again in the coming weeks, but Borussia's medical staff and director of sport Michael Zorc have confirmed the winger is expected back soon. After the Super cup showdown, Dortmund play fourth division side Eintracht Trier in the first round of the German Cup on August 22. That will be their last match before the new Bundesliga starts when they host Mainz on August 27 and have qualified directly for this season's Champions League after a year's absence."
49,13/06/2016,22:39,Man City 'target' extends Bilbao deal,Young French centre-back Aymeric Laporte extended his contract with Athletic Bilbao on Monday despite reported interest from Manchester City.,"The 22-year-old added a year to his existing deal and is now tied to the Basque club until June 2020, Bilbao said in a statement on Monday. The France under-21 captain is rumoured to be a target for new City manager Pep Guardiola. His new deal includes an increase in his buy-out clause from 50 million euros ($56.5 million) to 65 million euros, rising to 70 million euros in two years time. Laporte was born in Agen in the Aquitaine region of France but has Basque grandparents. Last year he said he would consider representing Spain if he wasn't called up by France coach Didier Deschamps for Euro 2016. He made his debut for Bilbao, his only professional club, in 2012."
50,14/04/2016,23:58,Sevilla's treble hopes alive after shoot-out win,Sevilla maintained their quest to win a third straight Europa League crown by ousting fellow Spaniards Athletic Bilbao on penalties on Thursday.,"Sevilla joined Liverpool, Shakhtar Donetsk and fellow La Liga outfit Villarreal in the semi-finals despite losing 2-1 at home. That made it a 3-3 tie on aggregate and after extra-time provided no more goals, the game went to penalties. Frenchman Kevin Gameiro scored the decisive spot-kick after Benat had his kick for Athletic saved by goalkeeper David Soria. Gameiro had also scored in normal time either side of strikes from Aritz Aduriz and Raul Garcia for Athletic. The tie of the round came in England where Liverpool hit back from 2-0 and 3-1 down to beat Borussia Dortmund 4-3 and progress 5-4 on aggregate. Playing against his former side, Jurgen Klopp's team trailed to goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Divock Origi pulled a goal back before Marco Reus restored the Germans' two-goal advantage. Liverpool needed three goals to progress due to the away goals rule and Dejan Lovren pounced to head home the injury-time winner after Philippe Coutinho and Mamadou Sakho had drawn the hosts level on the night. Villarreal striker Cedric Bakambu continued his sublime form with two more goals in a 4-2 win over Sparta Prague in the Czech Republic to complete a 6-3 aggregate victory. Shakhtar, the 2009 UEFA Cup champions, also powered into the last four with a 4-0 thrashing of Braga in Lviv. Darijo Srna converted a first-half penalty before Ricardo Ferreira twice put through his own net either side of a Viktor Kovalenko strike as the Ukrainians strolled through 6-1 on aggregate."
51,07/04/2016,23:23,"Klopp's Liverpool hold Dortmund, champions Sevilla win",Liverpool claimed an excellent 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday as Jurgen Klopp made an emotional return to the Westfalenstadion.,"The game marked Klopp's first coming together with his former club since his departure last summer and subsequent appointment by Liverpool back in October. He saw Divock Origi put the Premier League side in front in the 36th minute before Mats Hummels equalised for the hosts three minutes into the second half. However, that away goal means Liverpool have the upper hand ahead of next Thursday's second leg at Anfield and Klopp will be confident his side can progress to the last four after an encouraging display in Germany. ""Dortmund's a pretty good side. Everybody could see that but we had our moments and we could have won the game,"" Klopp told BT Sport. A rousing rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' -- the Liverpool hymn that is also a Dortmund anthem -- preceded kick-off as Klopp took in the scene at the stadium where he is still idolised after a highly successful seven years as coach. ""It was respectful, nice and how it should be,"" Klopp said of his welcome. But perhaps the emotion of the occasion got to the Bundesliga team because they were unable to repeat their superb performance in tearing Tottenham Hotspur apart in the last round. Their 36-goal leading scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was subdued and they were denied an opener when Mamadou Sakho bravely blocked a Henrikh Mkhitaryan shot. Dejan Lovren should have done better than head straight at Roman Weidenfeller at the other end but Origi put the visitors in front when he held off his marker and slotted low past the 'keeper after latching onto a Jordan Henderson flick. Weidenfeller prevented Origi from scoring again just before the interval and Dortmund drew level shortly after the restart, captain Hummels rising above Adam Lallana to head in a Mkhitaryan cross. Weidenfeller saved well from Philippe Coutinho and the final scoreline means the tie remains up for grabs, even if Liverpool have the edge. Meanwhile, holders Sevilla remain on course to win the trophy for the third season running after coming from behind to win 2-1 away to Spanish rivals Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of their tie. Sevilla have not won away from home all season in La Liga and, after a goalless first half in which Aritz Aduriz hit the post for the hosts, they went behind in the 48th minute. Iker Muniain crossed and the evergreen Aduriz headed in his 32nd goal of a remarkable campaign. But as the rain lashed down in the Basque Country, Sevilla silenced San Mames when Ever Banega pounced on a short headed back-pass by Muniain and set up Timothee Kolodziejczak to score. Kevin Gameiro then set up substitute Vicente Iborra to give Sevilla the win seven minutes from time and leave beaten 2012 finalists Athletic up against it ahead of the return leg. One Spanish side is guaranteed to make the last four and Villarreal hope to be there too after beating Sparta Prague of the Czech Republic 2-1 at El Madrigal. Cedric Bakambu got both goals for the hosts, charging down a clearance by goalkeeper David Bicik for the early opener and then scoring the winner in the second half after Jakub Brabec had headed Sparta's equaliser. Meanwhile Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk, the 2009 UEFA Cup winners, are in the driving seat in their tie against Braga after a 2-1 victory in Portugal. Yaroslav Rakitskiy fired Shakhtar ahead on the stroke of half-time and Facundo Ferreyra increased their lead before Wilson Eduardo grabbed a potentially vital goal for 2011 runners-up Braga late on."
52,30/03/2016,15:07,Bilbao's Laporte to miss rest of the season,Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte will be sidelined for the rest of the season after suffering a broken ankle on international duty as captain of the French under-21 team.,"Laporte underwent surgery in Bilbao on Tuesday and is expected to be out for three to four months to end his faint hopes of representing his country on home soil at the European Championships this summer. ""I have no doubt that we will miss Aymeric because he is a great player and offers us a lot,"" Athletic Bilbao boss Ernesto Valverde told the club's website. Athletic face holders Sevilla in the quarter-finals of the Europa League next month and also retain outside hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League as they lie seven points adrift of fourth-placed Villarreal in seventh in La Liga."
53,18/03/2016,13:24,"35-year-old Aduriz gets Spain call, Costa dropped",Veteran Athletic Bilbao striker Aritz Aduriz has been rewarded for his stunning form at the age of 35 with his first call-up to the Spain squad for six years as Chelsea's Diego Costa was dropped on Friday.,"Coach Vicente del Bosque named a 25-man squad for Spain's final two friendlies away to Italy on March 24 and Romania four days later before he names his final squad for Euro 2016. Aduriz's 31st goal of the season booked Athletic's place in the quarter-finals of the Europa League on Thursday at the expense of Gary Neville's Valencia. ""I have to say he is in because there has been widespread calls for him to be included, but also because he deserves it,"" Del Bosque said of Aduriz. ""He is playing well, scoring lots of goals and he is a centre-forward that we all like."" Costa has finally paid for his poor form at international level, where he has scored just once in 10 games for Spain since switching his allegiances to the European champions from Brazil before the 2014 World Cup. His controversial clash with Everton's Gareth Barry last weekend for which the striker was charged for improper conduct by the English FA after being sent-off was also met with widespread condemnation in Spain. However, Del Bosque highlighted an injury Costa suffered as Chelsea bowed out of the Champions League last week as the principal reason for him not being included. ""It is principally for health reasons. In the game on the ninth he went off with a quadriceps injury, he pushed himself to play four days later and ended up a bit sore. ""Diego has been playing well the past two months and we are counting on him. There are still two months to take a decision (for the Euros). ""Then there is the disciplinary aspect and it's clear we want everyone to behave well, but the situation he had with Barry wasn't very serious."" Barcelona's Sergi Roberto was handed his first call-up to the senior Spanish side, but club teammate Andres Iniesta was left out to due to a minor muscle problem. Real Madrid's Nacho and Barcelona's Marc Bartra retain their places as back-up to club teammates Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique in central defence despite a lack of playing time at club level. Madrid's Dani Carvajal misses out to Villarreal's Mario Gaspar as Juanfran's understudy at right-back. And Pedro Rodriguez, Paco Alcacer, Nolito and Alvaro Morata are all included alongside Aduriz amongst the strikers despite their lack of goalscoring form at club level."
54,03/03/2016,13:57,Athletic Bilbao boss Valverde agrees new deal,"Athletic Bilbao have extended coach Ernesto Valverde's contract by a year until the end of the 2016-17 season, the club confirmed on Thursday.","""Athletic Club and coach Ernesto Valverde have signed a renewal of his contract that will keep him with the red and whites until June 30, 2017,"" Athletic said in a statement. ""I am very happy to be able to enjoy Athletic for another year,"" said Valverde. ""I thank the club for the confidence they have shown in me to renew my contract."" Valverde is currently in the third year of his second spell at the club having also been in charge between 2003 and 2005. Earlier this season he delivered the club's first trophy for 31 years with a 5-1 thrashing of European champions Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. Athletic sit seventh in La Liga and have progressed to the last-16 of the Europa League where they face Gary Neville's Valencia. Valverde, 52, is highly respected in Spain and had been rumoured as a possible successor to Vicente del Bosque as the national team coach after the European Championships later this year."
55,02/03/2016,23:02,Ronaldo gets Madrid back to winning ways at Levante,Real Madrid bounced back from defeat to Atletico in the Madrid derby on Saturday to cut the gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to nine points with a 3-1 win at Levante on Wednesday.,"Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty and an own goal from Levante 'keeper Diego Marino put the visitors in command before Deyverson pulled one back for Levante before half-time. However, Isco's late strike from Ronaldo's cut-back secured the points in stoppage time. Real trail second-placed Atletico by four points, but do open up a four-point lead of their own on Villarreal after they were held 0-0 at Celta Vigo. Barcelona can extend their lead over Atletico at the top to eight points with victory at Rayo Vallecano on Thursday. Gary Neville's Valencia moved into the top half of the table as they benefited from spectacular own goal by Malaga goalkeeper Carlos Kameni to win 2-1 at La Rosaleda. Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane was without a host of first team regulars as the suspended Dani Carvajal and Sergio Ramos joined the injured Marcelo, Luka Modric, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema on the sidelines. Real had former Levante 'keeper Keylor Navas to thank for not getting off to a terrible start as he produced a brilliant save low to his left to prevent Giuseppe Rossi giving the home side a shock lead. Ronaldo caused controversy with an outburst claiming Madrid ""would be top"" of the league if his teammates matched his standards after defeat to Atletico at the weekend. The three-time World Player of the Year made amends by opening the scoring from the spot on 34 minutes after Lucas Vazquez had been tripped inside the area by Lucas Orban. Injuries to Benzema and Bale opened the door for 18-year-old Borja Mayoral to get his first league start and he took his opportunity when his shot from the edge of the box hit the post and cannoned into the net off Marino's back three minutes later. However, Levante were back in the game instantly as the Real defence were caught flat-footed appealing for an offside flag that never arrived and Deyverson slotted into the bottom corner. Madrid had much better control of the game after the break and Ronaldo was desperately unlucky not to restore their two-goal lead when he struck the post from James Rodriguez's fine through ball. However, Zidane's men needed to rely on Navas once more to secure the points as he made a flying save to parry Ruben Garcia's shot from distance. And Isco answered his recent critics with a calm finish from Ronaldo's cut-back in stoppage time to round off the scoring. Defeat leaves Levante still rooted to the foot of the table, six points off safety. Villarreal's hopes of temporarily usurping Real Madrid into third were dashed in a game of few chances in Vigo as the visitors registered a sixth consecutive clean sheet in La Liga. Sevilla closed the gap on Villarreal to nine points in their quest for Champions League football as Fernando Llorente's early strike handed the Europa League holders their 15th straight home win in all competitions, 1-0 over Eibar. Valencia moved up to ninth as they recovered from Duje Cop's early deflected opener to register just Neville's third league win. Kameni punched the ball into his own net under pressure from Denis Cheryshev just before half-time and Real Madrid loanee Cheryshev completed the turnaround when he fired into the bottom corner five minutes after the break. Aritz Aduriz continued his push to be included in Spain's squad for the Euro 2016 with a hat-trick in Athletic Bilbao's 4-1 win over Deportivo la Coruna to take his tally for the season to 30."
56,28/02/2016,18:05,"Neville's winning run ended, lucky 13 for Villarreal",Valencia's four-game winning run came to a sudden halt as Gary Neville's men were beaten 3-0 by Athletic Bilbao on Sunday in a dress rehearsel of their Europa League last-16 tie.,"Earlier, Villarreal moved to within two points of Real Madrid in third by stretching their unbeaten league run to 13 games with a comfortable 3-0 win over Levante. Valencia set the record for an aggregate win in the Europa League with a 10-0 thrashing of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, whilst victories over Espanyol and Granada had allayed any fears of a relegation battle. However, they have been drawn against Athletic in the last 16 of the Europa League and they will face a much tougher test to make it into the quarter-finals against a side who moved up to seventh in La Liga with three goals in seven second-half minutes at Mestalla. Sabin Merino was the Basques' hero as they saw off Marseille in midweek and he continued his goal-scoring form with a bullet header from Mikel San Jose's cross. Iker Muniain then doubled the visitors' lead from Mikel Rico's pass to register his first goal in 18 months. And Aritz Aduriz compounded a miserable afternoon for Neville by rising highest to head home Benat Extebarria's corner for his 27th goal of the season. Villarreal also ousted Napoli in Europa League action on Thursday, but showed no ill effects as goals from Leo Baptistao and Samu Castillejo put them 2-0 up inside half an hour against Levante. Adrian Lopez added a third with his first goal for the club just after the break. And Levante's miserable day was completed when captain David Navarro was sent off for a second bookable offence, meaning he will miss the visit of Real Madrid on Wednesday. A fourth defeat in five games leaves Levante still four points off safety in 19th. At the very least, Villarreal now look assured of a return to the Champions League next season after opening up an 11-point lead on fifth-placed Sevilla. Real Madrid's title hopes were realistically ended on Saturday as they lost 1-0 at home to Atletico Madrid. Victory moved Atletico to within five points of leaders Barcelona, but the European champions can reestablish their eight-point advantage when they host Sevilla later on Sunday."
57,26/02/2016,02:15,Derby win a must for Ronaldo in Barca chase,Cristiano Ronaldo insists Real Madrid can still catch La Liga leaders Barcelona if they can overcome their hoodoo against local rivals Atletico Madrid on Saturday.,"Real trail Atletico by a point and are nine adrift of Barca with just 13 games remaining, but can move up to second place should they beat Diego Simeone's men for the first time in six league games. ""It is a game we need to win,"" Ronaldo told Madrid's website. ""It is an important game at home, in front of our fans and against a very strong team that defends well. ""We know that (winning) La Liga will be difficult, but we need to fight until the end. Football is box full of surprises and anything can happen."" Real are expected to once again be without Gareth Bale as the calf injury that was initially expected to keep the Welsh star out for three weeks in mid-January drags on. Karim Benzema is likely to return having missed the 1-1 draw at Malaga last weekend, whilst James Rodriguez could start after being left on the bench by Zinedine Zidane at La Rosaleda. Zidane's record at the Bernabeu since taking over has been impeccable with four wins and 20 goals from four games. However, Atletico's rock-solid defence will pose a much more difficult obstacle to break down. Simeone's men recorded their 24th clean sheet in 38 games this season in a 0-0 draw at PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League in midweek. However, goals at the other end of the field has been the major problem for Atletico with just one in their last three games. ""The goal will come. We need to keep going and, if we have to be patient, I'll be the first to wait,"" said Simeone. Stefan Savic misses out through injury, so Jose Maria Gimenez will come into the Atletico defence. Meanwhile, Fernando Torres is likely to earn a recall to the starting line-up unless Yannick Carrasco recovers in time from an ankle ligament injury. Barca can maintain their stranglehold on the title race when Sevilla visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. The Andalusians' charge for a top-four finish has been maintained by their brilliant home form as they still haven't won away in the league all season. That run seems highly unlikely to chance as Barca seek to extend a 33-game unbeaten run in all competitions. However, the last time the European champions tasted defeat it was to Sevilla in October. ""Stats are there to be broken,"" said Barca's top scorer Luis Suarez. ""We are dedicated to playing well and getting good results."" With three La Liga games to come in seven days, Barca boss Luis Enrique is likely to rotate with the likes of Arda Turan and Sergi Roberto in line to start. Similarly with Sevilla aiming to catch Villarreal, who they trail by eight points, in fourth, coach Unai Emery may prioritise more winnable clashes with Eibar and Getafe in the next week. However, Villarreal are strong favourites to stretch their commanding lead over the Europa League holders to 11 points when they host Levante on Sunday. Gary Neville's upturn in fortunes as Valencia boss continued with a 4-0 win over Rapid Vienna on Thursday to seal a remarkable 10-0 aggregate win and a fourth consecutive victory in all competitions. With fears of being dragged into a relegation battle eased, Valencia could even challenge for a Europa League place should they continue their momentum at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
58,13/02/2016,20:21,Ronaldo double keeps Madrid pressure on Barca,Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice as Real Madrid overcame a stiff test from Athletic Bilbao to move within a point of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 4-2 win on Saturday.,"Ronaldo's early opener was cancelled out by Javi Eraso before a two-goal burst just before half-time from James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos put Madrid in control. Real were reduced to 10 men late on as Raphael Varane received a red card, but Ronaldo made sure of the points before Gorka Elustondo grabbed a consolation in stoppage time. Barca have two games in hand on Madrid and face Celta Vigo in the first of those on Sunday. Victory also extended Madrid's impressive run of five wins and a draw in six games since coach Zinedine Zidane took charge. ""You will always have errors, but I am not worried about that. I think we were good physically, on the ball and I am happy with what we did today,"" said Zidane. Ronaldo had been much criticised for his poor performance as Madrid struggled past Granada last weekend, but was sharp from the off back on home soil as he turned inside from Karim Benzema's pass and smashed home his 31st goal of the season. ""The press are here to opine on whether Ronaldo plays well or badly, if he is finished, but today he has showed he is bloody brilliant,"" added Zidane. However, Athletic reacted well to going behind in a hugely entertaining first half with chances flowing at either end. The visitors were level on 10 minutes when Varane's errant backpass was only parried by Keylor Navas into the path of Eraso to slot home. Navas then had to produce a brilliant save to parry Aritz Aduriz's powerful downward header. At the other end, Gorka Iraizoz also made a great save to deny Danilo. And Aduriz came close again on the half-hour when his deflected shot came back off the crossbar. However, the Basques were made to pay for their profligacy as Madrid showed their firepower with two goals in eight minutes before half-time. Rodriguez regained the lead with a trademark drive into the bottom corner from outside the box for just his fifth goal of the season. Kroos then put the game beyond Athletic as he received Ronaldo's pass just inside the area and saw his shot flick off Aymeric Laporte on its way past Iraizoz. Ronaldo came close to extending the lead when he struck the post from range just after the break. Navas was also called on to make another fine save to smother Aduriz's effort on the edge of the area after a rare wayward pass from Kroos. Madrid had to see out the final seven minutes with 10 men as Varane saw a second yellow card for leading with his elbow in an aerial clash with Aduriz. Yet, even with a man less, Ronaldo got his second of the afternoon to move ahead of Luis Suarez as La Liga's top goalscorer by controlling Lucas Vazquez's cross before firing home from close range. Athletic did eventually get the second goal their performance deserved in stoppage time when Elustondo rounded off the scoring from Oscar de Marcos's cross. Elsewhere, Villarreal strengthened their position in fourth thanks to Roberto Soldado's solitary goal in a 1-0 win over Malaga. Villarreal are now 11 points clear of Sevilla, who face Las Palmas on Sunday, in the fight for the final Champions League place."
59,21/01/2016,18:10,Athletic Bilbao wonderkid Williams signs new deal,Spanish under-21 international Inaki Williams committed his future to Athletic Bilbao by signing a new five-year deal on Thursday.,"""Athletic club and Inaki Williams have signed a deal to renew the player's contract...until June 30, 2021. ""His buyout clause will be 50 million euros."" Williams has been a revelation since breaking into the Athletic team last season. Athletic have maintained a unique transfer policy throughout their 118-year history of only playing players born or brought through academies in the greater Basque country. Born in Bilbao to a Ghanaian father and Liberian mother, Williams became the first black player to score for the club when he netted against Torino in the Europa League last year. He also scored in Athletic's 3-1 Copa del Rey final defeat to Barcelona in May and has 10 goals in all competitions this season. A significant increase in his buyout clause is designed to ward off interest from cash-rich Premier League clubs with both Arsenal and Liverpool rumoured to be interested in the 21-year-old."
60,20/01/2016,10:42,"Messi, Suarez out of Barca's Bilbao Cup trip",Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez will miss holders Barcelona's first-leg Copa del Rey quarter-final away to Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday and are absent from Luis Enrique's 18-man squad.,"Messi came off at half-time as Barca thrashed Athletic 6-0 in La Liga on Sunday and hasn't been risked despite scans ruling out a hamstring injury. Suarez scored a hat-trick at the weekend, but he completes a two-game Cup ban for confronting Espanyol players in the tunnel at the end of a fiery first-leg in the previous round. However, the Uruguayan had still been expected to travel to Bilbao with Barca's final appeal against the ban to Spain's Court of Arbitration for Sport not being held until Wednesday afternoon. Defenders Jordi Alba and Jeremy Mathieu also miss out due to hamstring and calf injuries respectively."
61,13/12/2015,22:31,"Real Madrid beaten again at Villarreal, Atletico joint top",Real Madrid's La Liga title hopes were dealt another huge blow as they suffered a third league defeat in five games to Roberto Soldado's solitary goal at Villarreal on Sunday.,"Atletico Madrid's 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao earlier in the day means Real now trail their city rivals and Barcelona by five points at the top of the table. Real were outplayed in the first-half, but reacted after the break and were left to rue a hat-trick of missed chances by troubled French striker Karim Benzema as defeat piles the pressure on under fire coach Rafael Benitez. Elsewhere, a late own goal salvaged a point for Valencia in Gary Neville's first taste of La Liga action as Los Che battled back with 10 men to draw 1-1 at Eibar. Real had won five consecutive games since being thrashed 4-0 at home by Barca last month, but were forced onto the back foot by a whirlwind start from Villarreal. Jonathan dos Santos had already smacked the inside of the post before Soldado turned home Cedric Bakambu's pass against his old club on eight minutes. Bakambu had two great chances to double Villarreal's advantage before half-time, but the Congolese striker pulled his shot wide when clean through on Keylor Navas before firing over from inside the area. Having been dominated in the first-half, Madrid came out a different side after the break and had a series of chances to turn the game on its head. Benzema had scored five times in his last two outings for Madrid despite his off-field problems which saw him indefinitely banned from playing for France in midweek, however his range was off as he volleyed inches wide from Gareth Bale's through ball. Another fine Bale cross was blasted over by Benzema moments later before Bale had a great chance himself, but on his weaker right foot didn't have the power to beat Alphonse Areola in the Villarreal goal. Benzema had one final chance to rescue a point, but his and Madrid's night was summed up when he headed wide when unmarked inside the area 17 minutes from time. Victory takes Villarreal back to within a point of fourth-placed Celta Vigo. At the Vicente Calderon, Atletico were forced to come from behind as they conceded for just the seventh time in 15 La Liga games this season when Aymeric Laporte swept home Benat Etxebarria's corner at the back post. Atletico had barely threatened in the first-half but levelled with the last action of the half as Saul Niguez headed in at the near post. Jan Oblak made two great saves at the start of the second period from Eneko Boveda and Aduriz to keep Atletico in the game. And they proved vital as Antoine Griezmann's stunning strike from 25 yards with Atletico's only serious effort of the second-half delivered a vital three points. ""We always work to be better and it is clear that we continue on our course, looking to improve without looking at the other teams,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""It is not easy to concede first and come back. We are happy with our work, but we don't understand any other way than through sheer effort."" Valencia escaped from Eibar with a point despite another disappointing display after crashing out of the Champions League against Lyon in Neville's first game in charge in midweek. Sergi Enrich deservedly opened the scoring for Eibar with the last kick of the first half. However, the turning point came midway through the second period when Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Domenech saved Saul Berjon's penalty after Lucas Orban had been very harshly sent off for supposedly elbowing Dani Garcia. And Valencia got the slice of luck they needed when David Junca turned the ball into his own net five minutes from time. A point leaves Valencia seven points off the top four in eighth. ""The last 20 minutes is the minimum that Valencia should show every week,"" said Neville. ""We wanted to win, a draw is not ideal, but it is positive given the circumstances."""
62,19/10/2015,15:58,Athletic Bilbao's Muniain ends injury nightmare,Athletic Bilbao winger Iker Muniain has been cleared for a return to action after six months out with cruciate ligament damage in his left knee.,"""The player has been given the all-clear due to the progress in his rehabilitation and his physical condition has allowed him to return to normal activity with the rest of the squad,"" the club said in a statement on Monday. Muniain missed the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona in May and the Spanish Super Cup as Athletic gained revenge over the European champions with a 5-1 aggregate win in August. However, he didn't miss out on the celebrations as Athletic won their first trophy for 31 years as he got a tattoo of the Super Cup on his right calf. Athletic sit 14th in La Liga after just two wins from their opening eight games."
63,30/08/2015,23:07,Atletico's Raul Garcia headed for Athletic Bilbao,Spanish international Raul Garcia is set to join Athletic Bilbao from Atletico Madrid after both clubs confirmed they had agreed a transfer fee on Sunday.,"""Atletico Madrid and Athletic Bilbao have reached an agreement in principle for the transfer of Raul Garcia to our club,"" Athletic Bilbao said in a statement on their website. ""The definitive agreement between the clubs and the player depends on the player passing a medical and the formalising of the contracts."" Garcia was a key player, scoring 17 goals as Atletico won La Liga and reached the Champions League final in 2013/14. However, he wasn't expected to feature heavily for Diego Simeone's side this season after the arrivals of Jackson Martinez, Luciano Vietto and Yannick Ferreira Carrasco at the Vicente Calderon during the summer. The 29-year-old watched Atletico's 3-0 win at Sevilla on Sunday from the stands after being left out of the squad, but was remembered by his teammates as Koke and Gabi celebrated their goals by holding up eight fingers -- Garcia's squad number at Atletico."
64,23/08/2015,20:34,Barca gain revenge in Bilbao thanks to Suarez stunner,Barcelona exacted revenge for their Spanish Super Cup defeat to Athletic Bilbao to get off to a winning start in La Liga thanks to Luis Suarez's solitary second-half strike.,"Lionel Messi's troubles from the penalty spot continued as he saw a first-half spot-kick saved by Gorka Iraizoz. However, his strike partner ensured that miss didn't prove costly as Suarez volleyed home early in the second-half to hand the champions all three points. Luis Enrique's men were returning to the ground where they were thrashed 4-0 in the first leg of the Super Cup just nine days ago and were without the suspended Gerard Pique, whilst Neymar wasn't fit to take part after just returning to training following a bout of the mumps. Athletic were also missing a number of first-team regulars, though, and struggled to match their high-energy performances in the two Super Cup matches after also playing in the Europa League on Thursday. After a quiet start the game burst into life when referee Carlos del Cerro Grande controversially pointed to the spot when Suarez went down under a challenge from Gorka Elustondo. However, Messi failed to open the scoring from the resulting spot-kick as Iraizoz flew to his right to make a brilliant save. The Argentine has now missed five penalties for club and country in the past year and failed to find the net in 14 of the 63 penalties he has taken for Barca. Iraizoz produced an even better stop moments later to prevent Suarez sweeping home Sergi Roberto's cross to ensure Athletic went in level at the break. The Uruguayan wasn't to be denied just eight minutes into the second-half, though, as he connected sweetly on his left-foot with Jordi Alba's cross. Roberto was deputising in an unusual position at right-back after replacing the injured Dani Alves midway through the first-half, but his impressive showing continued as he smashed a shot off the bar from a narrow angle as Barca threatened to double their advantage. However, the visitors suffered another injury blow when Sergio Busquets was stretchered off with an ankle problem and were left hanging on with a makeshift back four. Ibai Gomez had the Basques' best chance to equalise 10 minutes from time, but he blasted over when the ball fell invitingly inside the Barca box. And Messi nearly sealed the three points with a stunning individual run past a host of tired Athletic defenders, reminiscent of his opening goal in the Copa del Rey final between the sides in May, but his finish lacked the accuracy needed to beat Iraizoz."
65,21/08/2015,02:05,Barca face Athletic Bilbao demons on opening day,Barcelona won't have to wait long to try to correct the errors that saw them lose the Spanish Super Cup to Athletic Bilbao as they return to San Mames on Sunday in their La Liga opener.,"The European champions were thrashed 4-0 in Bilbao just a week ago as an under-manned Catalan defence failed to cope with the presence of Aritz Aduriz, who struck a hat-trick and then also netted in the return as the Basques won the final 5-1 on aggregate. Barca coach Luis Enrique has even more defensive problems as his side look for revenge on league duty. Gerard Pique has been banned for four matches after being sent off in Monday's 1-1 draw in the return leg of the Super Cup for verbally abusing the match officials. Jordi Alba remains a doubt with a hamstring injury, while Neymar hasn't returned to training since he was diagnosed with the mumps two weeks ago. The coach must also decide who to play in goal. Claudio Bravo made his first appearance of the campaign in the home game against Athletic after Marc-Andre ter Stegen had been selected for the first two matches of the season in which Barca conceded eight times. Bravo was the number one in La Liga last season, while Ter Stegen kept guard in the Copa del Rey and the Champions League. ""It would be nice for me to play in La Liga, but I don't know if I will. It is a decision that the coach has to take. For the moment, we need to train and work hard."" said Ter Stegen. ""Pique is an important player for us, we will miss him, but we have to try and do our best without him."" Athletic have injury problems of their own with Inaki Williams and Ander Iturraspe doubtful and they could pay physically for a busy schedule over the past week as, after a parade through Bilbao to celebrate their first trophy for 31 years, the Basques were back in action in the Europa League on Thursday away to MSK Zilina in Slovakia. Real Madrid begin life under Rafael Benitez away to newly-promoted Sporting Gijon on Sunday. Los Blancos have had a less than impressive pre-season, adding to doubts over whether Benitez was the right man to replace the popular Carlo Ancelotti after a season in which Madrid failed to win a major trophy. ""I saw plenty of positives and if we play like that I will be happy, but we still have plenty of margin to improve which is positive,"" said Benitez after Marcelo's late winner saw off Galatasaray in their final friendly in midweek. Benitez is likely to be without both Pepe and Karim Benzema as they have missed the majority of pre-season through injury, so Gareth Bale could be paired with Cristiano Ronaldo in attack with the Welshman expected to play in a more central role this season. Given Real's unusually quiet summer in the transfer market and Barcelona's ban on registering players, it is 2014 champions Atletico Madrid who have been the biggest spenders in the close season. Diego Simeone's men look well prepared to launch another bid for the title thanks to the signings of Jackson Martinez and Luciano Vietto from Porto and Villarreal respectively to complement Antoine Griezmann and Fernando Torres in attack. Atletico face another newly-promoted side in Las Palmas at the Vicente Calderon on Saturday as the islanders make their return to the top flight for the first time in 13 years. Valencia got their season off to a flying start with a 3-1 win over Monaco on Wednesday in the first leg of their Champions League play-off, but face a tricky trip to Rayo Vallecano for their league opener. Malaga and Sevilla have the honours in getting the league season underway as they face off on Friday night in an Andalusian derby. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
66,16/08/2015,02:15,Barca still believe despite four-goal deficit,Barcelona need to produce a monumental fightback on Monday to add the Spanish Super Cup to the four trophies they have already won in 2015 as they trail Athletic Bilbao 4-0 heading into the second leg.,"An under-strength Barca side was blown away by the Basques on Friday as they exacted revenge for defeat in May's Copa del Rey final at the Camp Nou thanks to Aritz Aduriz's hat-trick and a spectacular opener from just inside the Barca half by Mikel San Jose. It was the first time Barca had lost by four goals against Spanish opposition for eight years and the first time in 14 years they had conceded four times in two consecutive matches. The European champions had beaten Sevilla 5-4 after extra time in energy-sapping conditions in the Georgian capital Tbilisi to win the UEFA Super Cup just three days prior to their trip to Bilbao. And there is belief among the Barca squad that, with more time to prepare and back close to full strength at home, a remarkable turnaround is still possible. ""If there is anyone who can turn this around it is Barca,"" said coach Luis Enrique, whose decision to rest Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta from the start has been questioned. ""90 minutes at the Camp Nou. I believe,"" Pique posted on his official Twitter account on Saturday. Barca believe history could also be on their side. A Lionel Messi hat-trick sparked a 4-0 win over Sevilla in the 2010 Super Cup after a similarly weakened side had lost the first leg 3-1. Neymar and Jordi Alba are still missing through illness and injury respectively, but Luis Enrique could recall goalkeeper Claudio Bravo for his first appearance of the season in place of Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Athletic's first-leg performance was all the more impressive as they are also missing four first-team regulars through injury. Inaki Williams, Ander Iturraspe, Mikel Rico and Iker Muniain are all expected to miss out once more and Aduriz remains cautious. ""We cannot think that Barca in their stadium can't score four goals. They are the best and capable of doing anything."" Victory would end a 31-year barren run without a trophy for Athletic and would be particularly sweet after they lost the Copa del Rey final to Barca in three of the past seven years as well as the Super Cup in 2009. ""If we lift the Cup it will be the best night of my career,"" added Aduriz."

68,15/08/2015,00:14,Barca thrashed 4-0 by Aduriz-inspired Athletic,European champions Barcelona were stunned by an Aritz Aduriz hat-trick and brilliant opener from Mikel San Jose as Athletic Bilbao took a 4-0 lead into the second-leg of the Spanish Super Cup.,"Barca had picked up their fourth trophy of the year in Tbilisi on Tuesday with a 5-4 win over Sevilla in extra time in the UEFA Super Cup. But those exertions clearly took their toll as an under-strength side was dominated from the off by the Basques who exacted revenge for defeat in the Copa del Rey final back in May. San Jose fired in a volley from just inside the Barca half to break the deadlock before Aduriz struck three times in 15 second-half minutes to give Ernesto Valverde's side a huge advantage heading into Monday's second-leg. ""To score four against Barcelona is almost impossible. We are very satisfied with our work but the second leg is still to come and it is going to be very tough,"" Aduriz told Spanish TV station Telecinco. ""We cannot think that Barca in their stadium can't score four goals. They are the best and capable of doing anything."" Barca's defensive deficiencies had been laid bare in blowing a 4-1 lead against Sevilla that forced them into an energy-sapping extra 30 minutes in the Georgian capital. However, with Gerard Pique among four first-team regulars rested the Catalans were even more of a shambles at the back and this time couldn't be rescued by an off-colour Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. It is the first time in 14 years that the Catalans have conceded four times in two consecutive games. ""It is going to be difficult, but we have won many matches by many goals and we will try until the last minute,"" said a defiant Javier Mascherano. ""It is a one-off situation. They had four or five chances and scored four. Obviously that is not normal, especially given how we finished last season, but don't count us out yet. ""Now we have to correct what we did wrong, but above all prepare for the return leg."" San Jose began an unforgettable night for the hosts in fitting fashion as he pounced on Marc-Andre Ter Stegen's headed clearance to fire the ball beyond the German 'keeper from just beyond the halfway line. Barca slowly began to get back into the game, but they didn't seriously threaten until first-half stoppage time when Pedro Rodriguez was clipped on the edge of the area. Messi scored twice from free-kicks against Sevilla in midweek and couldn't have struck this one much better as Gorka Iraizoz flew to his right to claw the ball away from the top corner with an outstretched hand. The visitors twice came close to an equaliser at the start of the second period as Pedro fired off the underside of the bar before Iraizoz made another brilliant save to deny Messi from Suarez's clever cut-back. However, the game turned back in Athletic's favour when Sabin Merino beat Dani Alves for pace and his cross was powerfully headed home by Aduriz. More poor defending from Luis Enrique's men was punished nine minutes later as the ball ricocheted around the area before Aduriz smashed home on the turn. And the veteran striker was given the chance to complete his hat-trick when Alves was adjudged to have pulled down Borja Etxeita from a corner and Aduriz confidently sent Ter Stegen the wrong way from the spot. Messi and Suarez tried to lift the visitors in the final quarter, but even they couldn't find a way past a resolute Athletic defence. Barca now have a huge mountain to climb at the Camp Nou on Monday if they are to maintain their push to emulate Pep Guardiola's Barca side which won six trophies in a calendar year six years ago."
69,06/08/2015,21:00,Bilbao hold out in Baku to advance in EL,Athletic Bilbao did just enough to reach the Europa League play-offs by holding Inter Baku of Azerbaijan 0-0 in their third qualifying round second leg tie on Thursday.,"Having done the hard part in the home leg last week, they moved into Friday's draw 2-0 on aggregate. Rubin Kazan of Russia came into their second leg against seasoned European campaigners Sturm Graz 3-2 up from the away leg and survived a brief scare when Josip Tadic put the Austrians ahead on the night. But it was left to captain Oleg Kuzmin to steady the ship five minutes from the end with an equaliser which left it 1-1 to send Kazan through 4-3 on aggregate. It was an unhappy night for Cyprus' two teams hopeful of advancing. With Larnaca needing a miracle later on at home to Bordeaux to overturn a 3-0 deficit, both Omonia Nicosia and Apollon Limassol might have fancied their chances of a place in the next round. But in the event, Apollon's 1-1 home draw with FC Qabala did not prove enough in Azerbaijan as the home side grabbed the all-important winner 10 minutes from time when Javid Huseynov fired home from the penalty spot. Omonia must have thought they had done enough in Denmark when they held Brondby to a goalless draw last week, but they went out with their heads held high after a 2-2 draw in the Cypriot capital. Two penalties from Cillian Sheridan, in the 16th and 45th minutes, twice drew them level after Teemu Pukki had put Brondy in front in the second minute and again after 39, but that was how it remained and the Danes went through on away goals. The relative big guns involved at this early stage of the competition were mostly in action later, with Borussia Dortmund, beaten Champions League finalists only two years ago, defending a 1-0 lead at home to Wolfsberg of Austria. But Italian side Sampodria were facing a mission impossible away in Serbia where Vojvodina held a remarkable 4-0 lead from last week's first leg in Genoa. English Premier League duo Southampton and West Ham were both away, Southampton travelling to the Netherlands, 3-0 up on Vitesse Arnhem, while West Ham were up against it with their tie away to Astra Giurgiu finely poised at 2-2 after he Romanians grabbed a last-gasp[ equaliser in London. French side Saint Etienne looked comfortably through as they were at home to ASA Turgu Mures of Romania with a 3-0 cushion from the first leg. Bordeaux were in Cyprus against Larnaca with a similar advantage and Scotland's representatives, Aberdeen were hoping to overturn a 2-1 deficit against Kairat Almaty of Kazakhstan."
70,27/07/2015,22:20,Barca fined over whistling at Spain's king,"Spanish authorities Monday moved to fine FC Barcelona 66,000 euros ($67,000) and Athletic Bilbao 18,000 euros over last season's Cup final where fans of the Catalan and Basque sides whistled Spain's King Felipe VI.","The state Higher Sports Council proposed the sanctions for ""behaviour whose aim was to transform the sporting event into a stage for political demands through intolerant acts"". These included ""whistling the national anthem and His Majesty the King"", patron of the cup, the council said in a statement. It also proposed a 123,000-euro fine for the Royal Spanish Football Federation as organiser of the Copa del Rey final at Barcelona's Nou Camp ground on May 30, which Barca won 3-1. Fans of both sides drowned out the Spanish national anthem with boos and whistles at the start of the match. The controversy came at a time of high political sensitivities, with Catalan leaders campaigning for independence from Spain ahead of a key regional election expected in September. The sports council's Antiviolence Commission set various administrative fines for the whistling and for alleged security shortcomings including the burning of flares. Those targeted by the fines can appeal against them to the state authorities, who will hear their claims before making a final ruling. The fine against Barcelona consisted of 6,000 euros for failing to take sufficient action beforehand against groups that called the protests, and 60,000 for security breaches. The commission issued an 18,000-euro fine against Athletic Bilbao for failing to crack down on fans who announced their planned protests ahead of the match. It also issued fines for various Catalan pro-independence civil groups."
71,30/05/2015,23:39,Messi-inspired Barcelona win 27th Copa del Rey,A Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona sealed a league and Cup double as they swept aside Athletic Bilbao 3-1 to win the Copa del Rey for a 27th time on Saturday.,"Messi opened the scoring in spectacular fashion by dribbling past four Athletic players and lashing home a low finish before Neymar added a second before half-time. The Argentine grabbed his second of the game to kill the tie as a contest 17 minutes from time before Inaki Williams grabbed a consolation for the Basques. Despite Athletic fans dominating two-thirds of the 99,000 capacity Camp Nou, there was nothing their players could do to stop a rampant Barca that is now just one game away from just the second treble in the club's history. Luis Enrique's men face Italian champions Juventus in the Champions League final in Berlin on June 6. The game began in controversy after the Spanish national anthem was drowned by the fans of two clubs with strong separatist identities. On the field there was little to argue about as Messi tore Bilbao apart to continue their 31-year drought without winning a major trophy. The four-time World Player of the Yeat teed up Neymar for what should have been the opening goal just nine minutes in, but the Brazilian's effort was wrongly disallowed for offside. Luis Suarez then forced Iago Herrerin into the first of many fine saves with a low drive. Herrerin was left as helpless as the rest of his teammates 11 minutes later when Messi danced past Mikel Balenziaga, Mikel Rico and Benat Etxebarria tight on the touchline before turning inside Aymeric Laporte and smashing in at the near post. Even by the Argentine's incredibly high standards the move and finish was as good as any of his previous 410 Barca goals. Messi wasn't finished as he then turned provider for Suarez whose low cross was met by Neymar and brilliantly blocked by Herrerin. The Athletic stopper continued to frustrate Barca as he then stretched to turn Gerard Pique's effort from Messi's free-kick over. Barcelona did finally double their advantage nine minutes before half-time with Messi again heavily involved as he fed Ivan Rakitic who released Suarez and this time the Uruguayan's pass was rolled into an unguarded net by Neymar for his seventh goal of the competition. Athletic starlet Inaki Williams came closest to a reply before the break with a dipping volley that clipped the top of the crossbar. However, Herrerin had to be alive moments later to turn a free-kick from Messi behind. Perhaps with one eye on next weekend's Champions League final, Barca eased up slightly in the second period. Xavi Hernandez was brought on to savour his final appearance at the Camp Nou after a 17-year career. Messi added his 58th goal of the season as he pounced on some lackadaisical Athletic defending to prod home Dani Alves's cross. The Bilbao faithful did at least get something to cheer 11 minutes from time as the 20-year-old Williams notched just his third senior goal from Ibai Gomez's cross."
72,06/03/2015,02:16,Tough trip to euphoric Athletic awaits Real Madrid,Real Madrid's search for a return to form will be severely tested when the La Liga leaders travel to face an Athletic Bilbao side still high from reaching the Copa del Rey final on Saturday.,"Madrid saw their advantage over Barcelona at the top of the table cut to two points after being held 1-1 at home by Villarreal last weekend. Los Blancos have dropped seven points in their 10 La Liga matches since ending a trophy-laden 2014 on a 22-game winning run. And with a potentially decisive El Clasico clash with Barcelona now just two weeks away, Madrid can't afford many more slip-ups in their quest for just a second La Liga title in seven seasons. However, Bilbao is often a treacherous destination for the European champions with last season's 1-1 draw in which Cristiano Ronaldo was sent-off a case in point. After a difficult campaign, Athletic also come into the game in high spirits having set up a Cup final against Barcelona for the third time in seven years thanks to a 2-0 win at Espanyol on Wednesday. The Basques have also managed back-to-back league wins against Rayo Vallecano and Eibar to ease any relegation fears. Madrid will again be without the injured trio of James Rodriguez, Sergio Ramos and Sami Khedira, whilst Luka Modric remains unlikely to feature despite stepping up the intensity of his training after a three month absence due to a thigh muscle problem. Barcelona have an easier task on paper when they entertain Rayo Vallecano in the Sunday lunchtime kick-off. The Catalans will be without Sergio Busquets, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the 3-1 win over Villarreal in midweek which sealed a 6-2 aggregate victory in their Cup semi-final, but the club remains hopeful he will be fit to face Madrid and Manchester City later this month. Luis Suarez extended his scoring streak to five goals in five games in that match as he becomes an increasingly important part of a deadly front three also including Argentina and Brazil captains Lionel Messi and Neymar. ""Every week I try to help the team and I feel better on the pitch all the time,"" said Suarez. ""For a striker, it always makes you happy to score to help the team no matter what the competition is. The most important thing is to be useful."" The game of the weekend, however, comes at the Vicente Calderon as third faces fourth when Atletico Madrid host Valencia. A run of four consecutive wins has brought Valencia to within a point of the champions as they edge closer to a return to the Champions League next season. ""The goal is to get into the Champions League; that is paramount. It's what we on the team have in our minds,"" Valencia striker Paco Alcacer told the club's website. ""Obviously we are playing against the reigning champions, which makes things very difficult. ""What is perfectly clear is that we will try to get what we can from the game. We want to take the three points, but they are the favourites."" Atletico will be without their top scorer in La Liga Antoine Griezmann due to suspension, so Fernando Torres is expected to partner Mario Mandzukic in attack. However, Diego Simeone's men will be boosted by the return of Spanish international Koke to the starting line-up after he made his comeback as a substitute from a hamstring injury last weekend in a 0-0 draw at Sevilla.

""The estimated period of absence will be between four and six weeks,"" read a club statement. Bilbao, are currently 11th in La Liga and a distant 31 points behind leaders Real Madrid, as they also get set for a Spanish Cup semi-final first-leg fixture against Espanyol at home on Wednesday."
74,21/12/2014,23:36,Griezmann hat-trick leads Atletico to comeback triumph,France international Antoine Griezmann scored a hat-trick as Atletico Madrid produced a stunning second-half display to hammer Athletic Bilbao 4-1 away on Sunday and move to within four points of La Liga leaders Real Madrid.,"The Spanish champions looked on course for back-to-back league defeats for the first time since April 2012 when Mikel Rico gave Athletic a deserved half-time lead. But Griezmann levelled straight from the kick-off at the start of the second period and completed his hat-trick after Raul Garcia had put the visitors ahead from the penalty spot. Victory moves Atletico back to within three points of Barcelona, who were 5-0 winners over Cordoba on Saturday, in second. However, Real have a game in hand on their two main title rivals as they won their fourth trophy of the year in the Club World Cup final against Argentine side San Lorenzo in Morocco on Saturday. ""This was my best match since I've been here. I need to keep on this path and keep working,"" Griezmann said. At the new San Mames both sides were missing a number of key players with Aymeric Laporte and Ander Iturraspe banned for the hosts, while Atletico were without the suspended duo of Koke and Mario Mandzukic, as well as Miranda through injury. It was the Basque outfit who settled much quicker, and went ahead after 17 minutes when Markel Susaeta's free-kick was expertly nodded into the far corner by the unmarked Rico. Atletico failed to create anything of note in the opening 45 minutes, and could have been even further behind at the break had Aritz Aduriz decided to shoot when he was released clear on goal by Susaeta rather than trying to turn inside before being crowded out. However, the champions emerged a different side after an inspired half-time pep talk from Diego Simeone and equalised straight from the kick-off as former Real Sociedad winger Griezmann came back to haunt his old Basque rivals once more with a precise header from Juanfran's cross. Seven minutes later Atletico completed the comeback in controversial circumstances as the referee pointed to the spot when Tiago hit the floor under minimal contact between he and Mikel San Jose inside the area. Once the protests from the home fans and players had finally subsided, Garcia kept his cool to send Gorka Iraizoz the wrong way from the spot. If Ernesto Valverde's men felt hard done by at the penalty decision, they were handed a reprieve 22 minutes from time when Iker Muniain was extremely fortunate to escape with just a yellow card after a reckless studs high challenge into the knee of defender Jose Gimenez. That decision wasn't to prove too contentious, though, as Atletico wrapped up the points five minutes later when Griezmann pounced on a slip by Carlos Gurpegi to calmly stroke the ball past Iraizoz. The Frenchman sealed his first Atletico hat-trick nine minutes from the end thanks to more generous officiating as he tapped into an empty net despite clearly being in an offside position after the ball ricocheted off Garcia. Elsewhere, Villarreal and Malaga remained in the hunt for the top four with victories over Deportivo la Coruna and Elche respectively. It was a more comfortable afternoon for Villarreal at home to Depor as they recorded a seventh straight win in all competitions 3-0 thanks to Jonathan dos Santos's first goal for the club and two second-half strikes by the in-form Luciano Vietto. Malaga, meanwhile, had to come from behind to record a third consecutive league win after falling behind to David Lomban's header on the verge of half-time. However, second-half goals from Ignacio Camacho and on-loan Liverpool midfielder Luis Alberto mean they join Villarreal and Sevilla on 30 points, just one off Valencia in fourth."
75,13/09/2014,18:51,Neymar double continues Barca's perfect start,Barcelona made it three wins from three under new boss Luis Enrique as Neymar came off the bench to score twice in a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.,"The Brazilian had been left out of the starting line-up after his exertions in captaining his country for the first time in wins over Colombia and Ecuador in the past week, but made the difference in a tight contest when he slotted home from Lionel Messi's pass 11 minutes from time. And the two combined once more five minutes later as this time Messi breezed past three Athletic defenders before cutting the ball back for Neymar to side-foot home. Barca remain at the top of the table, five points clear of La Liga champions Atletico Madrid and six ahead of Real Madrid with both sides from the capital to face off at the Santiago Bernabeu later on Saturday. ""Messi is the best in the world. He is a star and I am improving with him,"" Neymar told Canal Plus. ""I am very happy with the game today. It went perfectly with the two goals. ""We knew we would suffer a little bit, but we managed to remain tight at the back and then went onto win the game."" Enrique was also quick to laud the impact made by Messi in creating both goals, as he also did for Sandro's winner at Villarreal two weeks ago. ""It is evident that he is best in the world in any attacking aspect,"" he said. ""This version of Messi helps us a lot because he is a game changer. He does things in training that you can't imagine, things I haven't even seen on the Playstation."" Fresh from making his debut with Spain in a 5-1 thrashing of Macedonia on Monday, 19-year-old Munir El Haddadi once again started ahead of Neymar and was a constant threat despite not having his best day in front of goal. Munir's first opening of the day came 20 minutes in when he collected Messi's pass and turned Oscar de Marcos with ease, but then fired wastefully over with just Gorka Iraizoz to beat. Athletic were coping comfortably with Barca in the final third, though, and threatened themselves when the excellent Ander Iturraspe broke into the box but his shot lacked the power to trouble Claudio Bravo. Barca upped the pressure on the Athletic goal just before half-time as Iraizoz did well to parry Ivan Rakitic's fierce low drive before spreading himself to block from Munir at point-blank range as the youngster latched onto another Messi assist. Munir thought he had broken the deadlock at the start of the second period as he swept home from close range, but was this time denied by the offside flag as he failed to time his run. Iraizoz was on top form once more to turn Jordi Alba's low drive behind and hold a powerful header from Munir, but Neymar's entrance just after the hour mark gave Barca the extra touch of class they needed to punish the Basques. Aymeric Laporte's wayward pass was picked off by Sergio Busquets and he fed Messi before the Argentine freed Neymar in behind the Athletic defence to roll home his first goal of the season. Messi played the role of provider once more six minutes from the end as he floated down the right wing and pulled the ball back for the unmarked Neymar to slot home. Both sides' attentions will now turn to Champions League action on Wednesday as Barca host Cypriots APOEL Nicosia and Athletic welcome Shakhtar Donetsk to the new San Mames in their first group stage game in the Champions League for 16 years."

Iraizoz was on top form once more to turn Jordi Alba's low drive behind and hold a powerful header from Munir, but Neymar's entrance just after the hour mark gave Barca the extra touch of class they needed to punish the Basques. Aymeric Laporte's wayward pass was picked off by Sergio Busquets and he fed Messi before the Argentine freed Neymar in behind the Athletic defence to roll home his first goal of the season. Messi played the role of provider once more six minutes from the end as he floated down the right wing and pulled the ball back for the unmarked Neymar to slot home. Both sides' attentions will now turn to Champions League action on Wednesday as Barca host Cypriots APOEL Nicosia and Athletic welcome Shakhtar Donetsk to the new San Mames in their first group stage game in the Champions League for 16 years."
77,19/08/2014,23:02,"Arsenal held, Athletic gain upper hand in Napoli",Ten-man Arsenal were left frustrated after a 0-0 stalemate at Besiktas in Tuesday's Champions League play-off round first leg while Athletic Bilbao earned the upper hand in their tie with Napoli following a 1-1 draw in Italy.,"Demba Ba nearly handed Besiktas a dream start in Istanbul when his audacious effort straight from kick-off came back off the crossbar after almost catching out Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Ba again tested Szczesny with a firmly-struck volley while Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla went close for the Gunners before Ba, who scored a hat-trick versus Feyenoord in the previous round, rolled a shot just wide of the post at the end of a lively opening 45 minutes in Turkey. Olcay Sahan spurned a glorious chance to put Besiktas in front early in the second half much to the chagrin of coach Slaven Bilic while Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will have to do without midfielder Aaron Ramsey in next Wednesday's second leg after the Welshman was dismissed for a second bookable offence 10 minutes from time. Arsenal nearly snatched victory in the closing stages but Tolga Zengin made a superb save to tip substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's effort onto the post and keep Besiktas very much in the tie. Athletic Bilbao secured a vital away goal through Iker Muniain just before the break in Naples and go into the return leg next Wednesday at San Mames as slight favourites despite Gonzalo Higuain netting a 68th-minute equaliser for Napoli in a 1-1 draw. Stefan Kiessling, Karim Bellarabi and Heung-Min Son were on target for Bayer Leverkusen side in Denmark as Roger Schmidt's men earned a 3-2 victory away to FC Copenhagen. Mathias Joergensen had cancelled out Kiessling's opener before Daniel Amartey put the Danes in front but strikes from Bellarabi and Son put Leverkusen in control of the tie. Goals in either half from Franz Schiemer and Jonathan Soriano earned Austrian champions Salzburg a 2-1 win at home to Malmo but Emil Forsberg's injury-time strike gave the Swedes a fighting chance of reaching the Champions League group stage for the first time. 1986 European champions Steaua Bucharest take a 1-0 advantage into the return leg against Bulgarians Ludogorets after Alexandru Chipciu struck an 88th-minute winner for the Romanian side."
78,26/06/2014,18:29,Bilbao's Herrera pays buyout for Man Utd move,"Athletic Bilbao midfielder Ander Herrera has paid off the buyout clause in his contract, the Spanish club said Thursday, opening the way for him to sign for Manchester United.","""Ander Herrera Aguera has fulfilled the requirements of the applicable regulations valid for unilateral termination of the employment contract that bound him to our club, by depositing today the amount of compensation established in the contract,"" Athletic Bilbao said in a statement. ""Athletic Club thanks Ander Herrera for his dedication during the three seasons he has enjoyed at the club and wishes him the best in his future sports projects."" The Basque club had earlier said it had rejected Manchester United's offer of 36 million euros ($49 million, £29 million) to buy Herrera, 24. The settling of the buyout clause by the player himself appeared to resolve the question of his move to Manchester, which British media had said was imminent this week. It would be the English club's first signing since they named Dutchman Louis van Gaal -- currently in charge of the Netherlands team at the World Cup -- in May as the successor to David Moyes. The Bilbao-born Herrera joined Athletic from Real Zaragoza in July 2011. He has scored 11 goals for Athletic in three seasons with the club, including two in the UEFA Cup. ""Athletic should aspire to have players whose first priority is defending the club's colours,"" said Athletic Bilbao's chairman Josu Urrutia in the statement. ""Ander Herrera's decision is not in line with that idea, which is a disappointment for the club."" afp"

British media reported on Tuesday that a deal could be wrapped within days for the 24-year-old Spaniard, whose fee will reportedly rise at the end of this month due to the terms of his contract. It would be the English club's first signing since they named Dutchman Louis van Gaal -- currently in charge of the Netherlands team at the World Cup -- in May as the successor to David Moyes."
80,22/05/2014,02:11,Football: Koke leads Atletico's resurrection,"There are few players that represent the turnaround in Atletico Madrid's fortunes since the arrival of Diego Simeone as coach than Jorge Resurreccion, or Koke as he is more commonly known.","Simeone's own resurrection of Atletico has carried the club to four trophies in two and a half years -- including a first La Liga title in 18 years this season -- and into Saturday's Champions League final against Real Madrid in Lisbon. A product of the Atletico youth academy, the 22-year-old has had a stellar season which has seen him become not just a regular in Simeone's set-up but also in the Spanish national team. However, he didn't always seem destined for great things. Koke was part of the Atletico side that were eliminated from the Copa del Rey by third-tier Albacete just days before Simeone's arrival in December 2011 and has admitted he was on the verge of leaving the club when the transfer market opened the following month. ""Simeone has helped me improve physically and on the ball,"" he told Spanish newspaper El Pais. ""When he arrived I was about to leave, I wasn't playing a lot and I needed minutes to keep improving. ""The manager told me to trust in him, that I wouldn't necessarily be a starter every week but to work hard because my opportunity would come. We believed in each other."" That trust has borne spectacular success for both men as on top of being Atletico's top creator with 18 assists this season, Koke has also shown an eye for important goals amongst his tally of seven for the season. He scored the winner in vital away victories at Real Sociedad, Malaga and Athletic Bilbao as well as scoring at home to Real Madrid in the 2-2 draw at the Vicente Calderon in March and the only goal of the game in the second leg as Atletico eliminated Barcelona from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage. That form will see him follow his best season at club level with his first senior international tournament at the World Cup after winning the under-21 European Championship last summer. ""I have blind faith in Koke, he thinks a lot about the team,"" said Spain coach Vicente del Bosque after naming Koke in his provisional 30-man squad for the tournament in Brazil next month. ""He has given a lot to Atletico and Atletico has given a lot to him. He can play in any position and he always does well. He is an important discovery."" Del Bosque's words have been shared by Spain's most decorated player of all-time in Xavi Hernandez, who believes the Atletico starlet will be his successor in the national team. ""He is destined to carry the baton in the Spanish national team for the next 10 years. He is already an extraordinary player,"" said the Barcelona midfielder. There have been rumours that Koke could even replace Xavi at Barca in the coming years, while he has also attracted interest from Manchester United. However, of more pressing importance is securing his status as a living legend amongst the Atletico fan base by being part of the first Rojiblancos side to win the Champions League and deny rivals Real their much-awaited 10th European crown in the process."

82,18/05/2014,22:26,Football: Osasuna relegated amidst barrier collapse chaos,"Osasuna and Valladolid were relegated to the Spanish second division on Sunday, but the final round of La Liga matches was overshadowed by the collapse of a barrier which injured 58 fans at Osasuna's El Sadar stadium in Pamplona.","The Navarran Red Cross confirmed 10 people, including children, were taken to hospital and a further 48 suffered minor injuries when the barrier gave way under the pressure of fans surging forward after Oriol Riera had given Osasuna the lead against already-relegated Real Betis. A number of spectators had to be carried to safety on stretchers with the players helping to lift them to safety. ""Many thanks to the Osasuna staff, security team, fans and a number of people that have collaborated with the work of our volunteers,"" the Navarran Red Cross added on their official Twitter page. The match was suspended for 35 minutes whilst the area was secured and the second halves in three other matches affecting the fight against relegation were also delayed so that all four finished at the same time. Once play got back underway Osasuna went on to win 2-1, but it wasn't enough to extend their 14-year stay in the Primera Division as Granada's 1-0 victory at Valladolid thanks to Stefan Mitrovic's own-goal condemned both sides to the drop. ""It is a very sad day personally and professionally for me,"" said Osasuna boss Javi Gracia. ""I am very sorry that the team has been relegated. I am sorry for the situation we have come to and I hope Osasuna will be back in the Primera as soon as possible. ""Despite winning, we didn't have it in our own hands and the results didn't go our way. At this time any analysis of the game and the situation has no meaning for me given the moment in which the team, the club and everyone is experiencing."" Betis manager Gabriel Humberto Calderon, meanwhile, criticised the stadium's state of repair. ""It had been many years since I had been to El Sadar. I was surprised by the state of the stadium in 2014 and the politicans need to do something to have a stadium that belongs to 2014 and Osasuna,"" he said. There was also disappointment for Valladolid as, despite taking points from both Barcelona and Real Madrid this season, they return to the Segunda after just two seasons in the top flight. ""I ask for the forgiveness of the club and the fans, I have not met the task handed to me when the club signed me last summer,"" said Valladolid boss Juan Ignacio Martinez. ""It is clear that I am the most responsible, but I keep my head held high because my behaviour and honour has been irreproachable."" Getafe ensured their safety as two goals from Ciprian Marica handed them a 2-1 victory at Rayo Vallecano, whilst a point was enough for Almeria as they drew 0-0 at home to Athletic Bilbao."

""Today Messi decided the game again,"" said the Spanish international. ""A lot of the time people demand too much of him. We need to leave him in peace and let him work."" A fourth straight defeat seemed on the cards when Aritz Aduriz put Athletic ahead five minutes into the second-half, but two goals in as many minutes sealed the points for Barca as Pedro Rodriguez tapped home from close range before Messi rifled in a free-kick from the edge of the area. Victory moved Barca into second place, two points ahead of Real Madrid having played a game more, but still four points adrift of leaders Atletico Madrid with four games remaining. Xavi, though, insisted they will fight until the end to try and defend their La Liga title in the hope that both Atletico and Real unexpectantly drop points before Barca host Atletico on the final day of the season. ""We knew how important today's game was, even though we don't have matters in our own hands. It is important to win and wait and see what happens. ""In general I think we played well both in attack and defence. To go out of the Champions League and lose the final of the Copa del Rey were two huge blows for the team, but we need to overcome them. ""Now we have to continue at the top of our game because this team still needs to fight."" Barca boss Gerardo Martino admitted to thinking it could have been another off day for his side in front of goal as they missed a host of chances before Pedro finally found a way through 18 minutes from time. And Xavi hailed the character shown by his teammates to come from behind after he had been controversially replaced by Cesc Fabregas much to the displeasure of the Camp Nou crowd. ""We could have finished the game off long before because we had played well. ""It is important to win the three points and still be in with a chance in the league. In the end the team showed great courage. We found it difficult, but we showed great character."""

97,03/02/2014,02:06,Football: Ancellotti unhappy at Ronaldo red card,Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti accused Athletic Bilbao's Carlos Gurpegi of exaggerated theatrics in the action that led to Cristiano Ronaldo's sending off in a 1-1 draw on Sunday.,"The recently crowned Ballon d'Or winner was given his marching orders 15 minutes from time, with the score already at 1-1, for appearing to hit out at Gurpegi after having a penalty appeal turned down. The away draw leaves Real three points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who moved to the top of the table with a 4-0 win over Real Sociedad earlier on Sunday. Ronaldo is now likely to be banned for another crucial league encounter against Villarreal next weekend and Ancelotti wasn't convinced his star man deserved to see red. ""I think it is difficult for me to judge because I wasn't there, but the images show that it was an exaggerated reaction,"" said the Italian. Brazilian defender Marcelo was stronger in his criticism of the decision. ""It is hard when you lose a player in an unjust manner. It is obvious that the decision wasn't fair and that made it very difficult, although our intention is to win every game,"" he told Spanish TV station Canal Plus. ""Athletic are a very good team, but we had bad luck today."" After withstanding some intense pressure from Athletic in the opening 45 minutes, Madrid looked set for an 11th consecutive victory in all competitions as Ronaldo's cross was turned home by Jese Rodriguez. However, a stunning strike from Ibai Gomez brought the hosts level before Ronaldo clashed with Gurpegi. Madrid then had Diego Lopez to thank for salvaging a point as the keeper tipped over another dipping effort from Gomez before denying Aritz Aduriz late on. ""The game was difficult for both teams,"" added Ancelotti. ""In the first-half Athletic pressed a lot and that made it difficult to play the ball on the ground so we played more on the counter-attack. ""In the second-half, the intensity of their pressure dropped a bit and we played better in possession, we scored and had good control of the game. ""Bilbao scored a fantastic goal, but in general I personally am satisfied with how Real Madrid played."" Following Barcelona's shock 3-2 defeat at home to Valencia on Saturday, Atletico took advantage of the Catalans slip up to become outright leaders for the first time since they won the league in 1996. On an emotional evening at the Vicente Calderon as former players and the paid homage to former Spain and Atletico player and manager Luis Aragones, who died on Saturday, David Villa settled the early nerves as he turned home the opener eight minutes form half-time. And after a spirited challenge from Sociedad after the break, three late goals from Diego Costa, Miranda and Diego Ribas propelled the hosts into top spot. Coach Diego Simeone, however, continued to deflect attention from Los Rojiblancos' chances of going all the way in the title race, preferring to concentrate instead on his side's meeting with Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. ""The objective is clear: the next game. Now we have the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. ""We need to recover and see how far we can go. After that we need to keep recovering after every game because we are playing every three days. It will take a huge effort, but we will see how we deal with it."""

99,01/02/2014,15:05,Football: Bale out of Madrid trip to Bilbao,Welsh winger Gareth Bale will miss a second consecutive game due to a calf injury as Real Madrid travel to fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao in a key La Liga clash on Sunday.,"Bale was substituted at half-time in last weekend's 2-0 win over Granada due to the problem and has been unable to train with his teammates all week. The 24-year-old has now missed a total of eight games to injury in four separate spells since joining from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported 91 million euros ($122.7million) back in September. However, Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti is confident he will be fit in time for the first leg of Real's Copa del Rey semi-final against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. ""He is not available for tomorrow because he hasn't trained all week with the group,"" Ancelotti told a press conference on Saturday. ""Tomorrow he will train and he will be available for Wednesday. He doesn't need another mini pre-season. The problem he had was very small, he just needs to train and gain confidence. ""His problems don't worry me. Before he had a knock and was out for 20 days, but when he came back he played well. Now he has a small problem, but it is not a serious injury."" Madrid enjoyed a perfect January as they racked up eight wins and eight clean sheets to move to within a point of Atletico Madrid and Barcelona at the top of La Liga, as well as progressing to the last four of the Cup. However, Ancelotti knows that facing an in-form Athletic team, who have scored 15 goals in their last three league games, will be a stiff test of his side's title credentials. ""It is a very good test looking at the table. They are a very strong team and they don't need to prove anything. ""We have a period of important games coming up. January was a good month and we have the ability to repeat what we did in them in February. What we did in January could allow us to have a very good next couple of months."" Jese Rodriguez, who scored the winner against Espanyol in a 1-0 win in midweek, is expected to keep his place in the absence of Bale. And there is some good news on the injury front as French defender Raphael Varane returns to the squad for the first time since November."

101,29/01/2014,23:59,"Football: Atletico, Barcelona into Cup semi-finals",Holders Atletico Madrid set up a mouthwatering Copa del Rey semi-final with city rivals Real Madrid after beating Athletic Bilbao 2-1 on Wednesday to win 3-1 on aggregate.,"Barcelona also assured their place in the last four with a 5-1 victory over Levante at the Camp Nou to seal a 9-2 rout on aggregate. In Bilbao, Aritz Aduriz had powered the hosts into a deserved lead four minutes before half-time and Athletic were only denied a bigger advantage at the break by two outstanding saves from Thibaut Courtois. However, Atletico regrouped at the break and levelled 10 minutes after the restart when Raul Garcia smashed home Emiliano Insua's cross. Diego Costa sealed their passage into the last four in the final stages as he slotted home his first goal of 2014 on the counter-attack to inflict Athletic Bilbao's first ever defeat at their San Mames ground, which they have used since the start of the season. Atletico will travel to the Santiago Bernabeu, where they beat Real 2-1 in last year's final, for the first leg of the semi-final next week with the return to come at the Vicente Calderon the following week. ""In the first 30 minutes we were in control of the tie, if not the match,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""From then until half-time they had a great end to the half, but we came out strong in the second-half and got the goal which gave us confidence and strength."" Simeone's men will now face Real three times in little over three weeks in league and Cup. However, they are unbeaten in four meetings against Madrid and Barcelona this season and the Argentine feels his side now believe they can compete with Spain's big two. ""This season we will play four more games against Barcelona and Real Madrid and that is good because it tests you more, but you also lose the fear of playing in those games."" Barcelona's passage into the semi-finals was far smoother as they thrashed Levante at a sodden and sparsely populated Camp Nou. Sergi Roberto's early own goal had given the visitors some hope of an improbable comeback from last week's 4-1 defeat. However, that was quickly extinguished as Adriano's long-range strike and Carles Puyol's thumping header gave Barca the lead on the night before half-time. Two goals in quick succession after the break from close range by Alexis Sanchez extended the hosts lead. Cesc Fabregas rounded off the scoring as his low effort beat Javi Jimenez at his near post 21 minutes from time."
102,26/01/2014,21:37,Football: Atletico Madrid see off Rayo to move top,Atletico Madrid moved back to the top of La Liga thanks to a comfortable 4-2 win at Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.,"David Villa gave the visitors the perfect start with his 11th goal of the season, but Diego Simeone's men were thankful to goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois moments later as he saved Jonathan Viera's penalty. Arda Turan doubled Atletico's advantage at the end of a fine team move and the Turkish midfielder was on hand to double his tally just before half-time after Viera's strike had briefly given Rayo hope. Saul Niguez's then put through his own net under pressure from Diego Costa to make it 4-1 before Joaquin Larrivey's headed consolation rounded off the scoring. Los Rojiblancos now lead local rivals Real Madrid by one point, but Barcelona can move back level with Atletico at the top should they beat Malaga at home later on Sunday. With top-scorer Costa still to score in seven games in 2014, Villa's return to goalscoring form has come just at the right time and he slotted away the opener confidently from Costa's unselfish cut-back. And Spain's all-time leading scorer was delighted to net his second goal in as many league games. ""I am very happy to be able to help the team get the victory and score a goal,"" said Villa. ""It is very important to continue winning, particularly away from home."" However, he insisted his side wouldn't dwell on their position atop the table as they now prepare for their Copa del Rey quarter-final, second leg away to Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday night. ""We can't think about being leaders. Now it is the time to think about the Cup and we need to keep going game by game."" Rayo had the perfect chance to level just four minutes later when Manquillo was harshly adjudged to have clipped Alberto Bueno inside the area. However, Courtois dived low to his right to palm away Viera's resulting spot-kick. Rayo keeper Ruben Martinez then kept his side in the game with an excellent double save from Costa and Jose Sosa. But there was nothing he could do to prevent Atletico doubling their lead on the half hour as excellent play from Costa and Sosa teed up Turan to roll into an empty net. Viera halved the deficit nine minutes later as his shot deflected off Miranda past the helpless Courtois. The visitors restored their two-goal cushion before half-time, though, as Turan slotted home Gabi's free-kick from a tight angle at the back post. Costa thought his moment had arrived 16 minutes from time as he stretched to meet Filipe Luis' low cross, but the ball clipped Saul on its way into the net and was credited as an own goal. Larrivey pulled another goal back for Rayo almost instantly from Viera's cross, but there was to be no late drama as Atletico returned to winning ways after two draws in their last two league outings. A 15th defeat of the season leaves Rayo still rooted in the relegation zone, five points off safety. Earlier, Athletic Bilbao continued their fine form with a 5-1 win away to Osasuna to move five points clear of Villarreal in the fight for the fourth Champions League place."

105,03/01/2014,02:15,"Football: Barca, Atletico jostle for position, Basque derby on cards","After a short winter break, Spain's top-flight clubs are back in action this weekend with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid jostling for position at the top of the table and a Basque derby also on the cards.","Reigning champions Barcelona and Diego Simeone's Atletico are level on points at the top and are due to face each other in a mouthwatering fixture in Madrid next weekend. Prior to that, though, Atletico go to Malaga on Saturday and Barcelona entertain Elche on Sunday before both sides have Copa del Rey ties to think about in midweek. Atletico, who have signed Argentine midfielder Jose Ernesto Sosa on loan from Metalist Kharkiv until the end of the season, will face a Malaga side who won their last two league games of 2013 to climb up into mid-table. Brazilian full-back Filipe Luis insists that the Rojiblancos are fully focused on their trip to La Rosaleda as they look to keep the pressure on Barcelona. ""Knowing the coach and the squad, nobody is thinking about the Barcelona game. Maybe the supporters are, but we all know that the Malaga match is vital,"" he said. ""We have not won there in two or three years and it is a difficult venue for us."" Both Atletico and Barca have enjoyed stunning starts to the campaign, winning 15 and drawing one of 17 games in La Liga, but the Catalans have not always performed convincingly since Gerardo Martino took over as coach in the summer. Nevertheless, the champions have been boosted by the return to the squad of goalkeeper Victor Valdes after injury, while Lionel Messi is also edging closer to a comeback. Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta is hoping a win against Elche - who sit just two points above the drop zone - can set his team up for a successful 2014. ""A good new year for us means winning everything"" said the man who scored Spain's World Cup-winning goal in 2010. ""When you have the chance to reach the top, you have to fight hard, and that's the kind of ambition that we hope will take us into April and May in contention. The team is playing well, and we need to grow from here."" Real Madrid, who sit third in the table, five points adrift of the top two, are in action on the Monday Three Kings Day holiday with a home fixture against Celta Vigo at the Santiago Bernabeu. The extra time to prepare for that game was used up playing in a glamour friendly against Paris Saint-Germain in Qatar on Thursday, which Carlo Ancelotti's team won 1-0 thanks to a first-half goal from young striker Jese. ""We are coming from behind but we have the whole second half of the season to come back and win the league,"" Ancelotti said. The first weekend of the New Year features the enticing prospect of a Basque derby between fifth-placed Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao at Anoeta. Athletic sit four points clear of their neighbours in the final Champions League qualifying position and have lost just one of their last 10 Liga games. Meanwhile, la Real, who finished fourth last season, have doubts over several players for the game, including the influential Xabi Prieto. That is not the only derby on the cards, with Valencia entertaining city rivals Levante at the Mestalla in what will be their first game since the appointment of Argentine-born former Barcelona and Spain striker Juan Antonio Pizzi as coach.

107,19/12/2013,13:57,Football: Real boss decries 'campaign' against Spain,"Real Madrid president Florentino Perez on Thursday decried a European investigation into state aid for seven clubs, saying the allegations were an unwarranted campaign against Spanish football.","Perez hit out a day after the European Commission launched a probe into seven Spanish football clubs, including Real Madrid and Barcelona, after complaints they had accepted illegal state aid. Brussels is notably looking into whether Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna benefited unduly from their status as associations owned by their members, which pay a 25-percent tax rate instead of the usual corporate rate of 30 percent. The European authorities also want to know whether the clubs enjoyed unfair exemptions from social security contributions and tax debts. ""I think there is a campaign against Spanish football and I think it is bad,"" Perez said in unscheduled comments during a Madrid breakfast conference organised by Spanish news agency Europa Press. ""The difference between the corporate tax rates of 25 percent and 30 percent has been so damaging to Real Madrid,"" Perez said. In the past 10 years, Real Madrid had to pay to the taxman an extra 13 million euros ($18 million), which it could have deducted as a reinvestment if the club had been set up as a normal company, Real's president said. Financially, Real Madrid's status as an association was thus ""a negative"", he said. Perez criticised, too, the Commission's investigation into a 2011 property transfer between Real Madrid and the Madrid city hall, saying the deal had already been thoroughly probed. ""There has already been a complaint. There has already been an investigation. They have already tried to harm us. And nothing happened,"" the club boss said. The European Commission said the land swap was ""very advantageous"" for Real, with a plot of land owned by the club being valued at 22.7 million euros, up from a 1998 estimate of 595,000 euros. Spain's secretary of state for sport, Miguel Cardenal, said the allegations had hurt Spanish sport. ""The image of Spanish football and Spanish football has been seriously tarnished. That is the reality,"" he told the same conference. The alleged tax advantage for Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna over the last four fiscal years amounted to 1.6 million euros in total, he said. ""If the complainant is right, the enormous scandal we are talking about amounts to 100,000 euros per team per year,"" Cardenal said. ""It is preposterous to believe there has been state aid."""

110,15/12/2013,23:00,Football: Costa double takes Atletico level with Barca,Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona at the top of La Liga as a double from Diego Costa guided them to a 3-0 win over Valencia on Sunday.,"After a disappointing first-half, Costa opened the scoring in style with a stunning individual effort 14 minutes after the restart. Just four minutes later substitute Raul Garcia rattled home a loose ball inside the area to seal the three points. Costa then saw a penalty saved by Diego Alves, but made no mistake when handed a second opportunity from the spot six minutes later to move level with Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga's top scorer on 17. Both Atletico and Barca, on 43 points from 16 games, now have a five-point lead over Real Madrid after Los Blancos could only manage a 2-2 draw at Osasuna on Saturday. Atletico boss Diego Simeone made seven changes from the side that started in the 2-0 Champions League win over Porto in midweek as he resorted to his strongest available line-up. However, the hosts still found it hard going in the opening 45 minutes as Valencia controlled possession without posing a threat to Thibaut Courtois's goal. Atletico started the second period with far more urgency and after Tiago had turned Miranda's cross just wide, Costa ran half the length of the field before finishing low past Alves. Garcia then came on to replace David Villa and with virtually his first involvement in the game he made it 2-0 with an accurate drive into the far corner from inside the area. Costa's direct running was causing the Valencia defence all sorts of problems and he had the chance to make it three when he was pulled down by Victor Ruiz inside the area 15 minutes from time. But Alves dived to his right to turn away the resulting penalty -- the third time Costa has missed from the spot already this season. Costa wasn't to be denied a second time, though, as after he had been felled by Antonio Barragan, he blasted high past the helpless Alves. Earlier, Athletic Bilbao strengthened their position in fourth place with a 1-1 draw away to Sevilla. Alberto Moreno fired the hosts in front after four minutes only for Markel Susaeta to level two minutes later. Susaeta also saw a first-half penalty saved by Beto, but in the end Athletic were happy to settle for the point which moves them two clear of fifth-placed Villarreal. Real Sociedad moved to within four points of their Basque neighbours Athletic as they hammered bottom of the table Real Betis 5-1 at Anoeta. Imanol Agirretxe scored twice, whilst Antoine Griezmann, Ion Ansotegi and Xabi Prieto were also on target as Sociedad recorded their third straight league win. And Almeria moved out of the relegation zone with a 0-0 draw at home to Espanyol."

113,29/11/2013,02:10,Football: Beaten Barca looking for response in Bilbao,Midfielder Xavi Hernandez believes Barcelona have to recover the intensity in their play if they are to avoid a first league defeat of the season when they travel to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.,"The Catalans were beaten for the first time in 21 games since Gerardo Martino took charge in July on Tuesday as they produced an insipid display in going down 2-1 to Ajax in Amsterdam in the Champions League. Defeat was the first sign that Barca could be missing the influence of the injured Lionel Messi and Victor Valdes, but Xavi insisted those that are available have to show the right attitude when they face Athletic. ""They are important players and you are going to miss them, but that wasn't the principal reason for the defeat. We didn't do enough to win. ""We need to have intensity from the start and in San Mames it will be another test. ""We need to turn it around and go for it from the off with that intensity that we lacked (against Ajax)."" Barca are likely to also be without full-backs Adriano, Jordi Alba and Dani Alves on Sunday, but Sergio Busquets and Alexis Sanchez will return after being rested in midweek. Athletic have had an impressive start to the campaign themselves as Monday's 2-1 win over Malaga moved them to within a point of Villarreal in the final Champions League spot. Ernesto Valverde's side are unbeaten at home since the opening of the new San Mames in September with four wins and two draws from six games at their new stadium. The visit of the league leaders will prove their biggest test to date, but striker Aritz Aduriz is hoping they can take advantage of Barca's series of injuries. ""They are very important players for them. We will see if we are capable of taking advantage of it, although the other players have all it takes to replace them,"" he told sports daily Marca. ""To me they seem just as good as always. Until now they have won almost every game. Their level is just as good if not better than in previous seasons."" Real Madrid have the chance to cut their gap to Barcelona to three points for 24 hours at least when they host Valladolid on Saturday. Carlo Ancelotti's men continued their free-scoring form with a 4-1 destruction of Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday despite playing the majority of the match with just 10 men. Madrid have now scored 26 times in their last six games at home and in Europe and could be boosted by the return of Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese missed Wednesday's game due to a slight muscle strain, but Ancelotti confirmed that the player himself is confident he will be fit in time to face Valladolid. And even if La Liga's top scorer doesn't make it, Valladolid boss Juan Ignacio Martinez is aware of the daunting task facing his side. ""It is very difficult to get anything there because they are very good and, moreover, they have gained a lot since the return of Xabi Alonso,"" he said. ""We will try to compete well and hopefully remove the bad taste in our mouth we had after defeat in the last game against Osasuna."" Second-placed Atletico Madrid are also in action on Saturday away to Elche as they too can put the pressure on Barcelona by moving level on points with the Catalans. Diego Simeone will recall a number of first team regulars, including Diego Costa and David Villa, having left six players back in Madrid to rest while the remainder of his squad travelled to Russia for a 1-1 draw with Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League in midweek.

Villa then made the game safe with a quickfire brace just after half-time. La Liga's top-scorer Diego Costa took his tally to 13 goals in 13 games in all competitions when he slotted home from Villa's pass 25 minutes from time before Gabi rounded off the scoring in stoppage time. Torres had been handed a start in place of the injured Arda Turan and the Spanish Under-21 international was in the right place at the right time as he slotted home at the back post from Koke's cut-back. Atletico boss Diego Simeone was happy with the impact that Torres made not only with his goal, but his overall display. ""I could see that the team needed the characteristics that Oliver has. ""He was ready to play and he responded brilliantly today. I expect a lot of him, but he is young and still learning."" Costa ought to have scored twice before half-time as he firstly slotted wide when clean through on goal and was then denied by Betis keeper Guillermo Sara who stood up well to turn his effort behind for a corner. Sara had to be replaced by Stephan Andersen at half-time due to an injury, but the Dane's first job was to pick the ball out of the net as Villa neatly flicked home Costa's cross at the near post eight minutes after the restart. And three minutes later Villa smashed home his fifth goal of the season after Koke's pass towards Torres deflected fortunately into his path. ""In the second-half we found Villa in the areas where he lives, in the box,"" Simeone added. ""It is normal for a player of his standing to need to score. We need the best version of Villa and today we saw a glimpse of that."" Costa finally got the goal he craved when Villa's lovely through ball allowed him to plant a left-footed finish into the far corner. He was then withdrawn with one eye on the upcoming league matches against Granada and Athletic Bilbao in mind, but Atletico still had one more goal in them when Gabi fired low into the corner with the last kick of the game. Villarreal strengthened their hold on fourth spot with a 4-1 thrashing of Valencia at the Madrigal. Early goals from Ikechukwu Uche and Hernan Perez put the hosts 2-0 up at half-time before a Giovanni Dos Santos double completed the rout after the break. Real Sociedad continued their recovery with a 3-0 win over the still winless Almeria to move up to ninth. Sevilla also moved into the top half of the table with a 2-1 win over 10-man Osasuna."

125,12/08/2013,02:32,Football: La Liga transfers - six to watch,Six key signings to look out for as the new La Liga season gets underway on Saturday:,"NEYMAR (Barcelona) By a distance the most discussed transfer in Spanish football this close season was Neymar's 57 million euro ($74m, £48.7m) move from Santos to Barcelona. The 21-year-old had long been linked with a move to the Spanish champions, but Barca's 7-0 two-leg humiliation at the hands of Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League semi-final accelerated the Catalans push for an extra option in attack. How Neymar combines with World Player of the Year Lionel Messi remains to be seen, but as he showed in a starring role at the Confederations Cup in June, the Brazilian international has the pace, skill and finishing ability to give Barca the reliable scoring outlet apart from Messi that they have lacked in recent seasons. ISCO (Real Madrid) Somewhat scorned by Barcelona's dominance of the Spanish national team in recent times, Real Madrid have invested heavily in two of the squad that helped Spain retain their Under-21 European Championship title in June. Isco was the first to arrive for a reported fee of 30 million euros after leading Malaga to the quarter-finals of the Champions League last season on their first participation in the competition. However, whilst the 22-year-old has shone brightly in pre-season, he may find first-team opportunities in his preferred play-making role behind a main striker limited at the Bernabeu due to the presence of German international Mesut Ozil. ASIER ILLARRAMENDI (Real Madrid) Having secured Isco, Madrid then spent 38.9 million euros to activate Illarramendi's release clause from Real Sociedad in a move intended to see the 23-year-old eventually succeed the ageing Xabi Alonso. Like Alonso, Illarramendi has a fine range of passing and is most effective playing just in front of the back four. And whilst the incredible wealth of midfield options available to new Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti may make it difficult for Illarramendi to claim a place in the side straight away, he will see plenty of minutes as Alonso is rested for the more straightforward league games later in the season. DAVID VILLA (Atletico Madrid) As soon as Neymar's move to Barcelona was confirmed it seemed inevitable that Villa would be on his way out of the Camp Nou and Atletico have arguably done the best business of the transfer window by snapping up Spain's all-time record goalscorer for an initial fee of just 2.1 million euros. Diego Simeone's side were in the market for a striker having sold Radamel Falcao to big-spending Monaco and it is hoped that a regular place in the side and playing as a central striker as opposed to the wide position he occupied at Barcelona will see Villa recover his golden touch in front of goal. Until breaking his tibia midway through the 2011-12 season, the 31-year-old had scored at least 20 league goals for 10 straight seasons and should he repeat that figure, Atletico will be well-compensated for the loss of Falcao who scored 70 goals in his two seasons in the Spanish capital. BENAT ETXEBARRIA (Athletic Bilbao) With so little money being spent by those outside the big two, the most significant transfer between two Spanish clubs not involving Madrid or Barca was Benat's return to Athletic Bilbao from Real Betis for eight million euros. The Basques were still flush with cash from the sale of Javi Martinez to Bayern Munich for 40 million euros last year and struggled mightily last season having failed to replace the Spanish international. Whilst Benat offers a lot more flair and less power than Martinez, he should make an excellent signing for Athletic with the service he provides allowing Ander Herrera, Oscar de Marcos and Iker Muniain to recover the form they showed in the 2011/12 season when Athletic reached both the Copa del Rey and Europa League finals. Benat's excellent delivery from set-piece situations will also be a handy asset as with the likes of Mikel San Jose, Kike Sola and Aritz Aduriz in their ranks, Ernesto Valderde's men will be extremely dangerous from corners and free-kicks. KEVIN GAMEIRO (Sevilla) The biggest transfer fee paid by a club outside the big two was Sevilla's capture of Gameiro from Paris Saint-Germain for a reported 10 million euros. A former French international, Gameiro had seen his playing time with the French champions severely limited by the signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic last season but could be given a new lease of life in a very new-look Sevilla side. Spanish internationals Alvaro Negredo and Jesus Navas have both gone to Manchester City, but Gameiro should still be able to rely on decent service from Ivan Rakitic and Piotr Trochowski as he returns from nearly a year out through injury."
126,12/08/2013,02:30,"Football: Gap widens as Barca, Real spend and rest sell","Looking at the Spanish sports pages over the typically baking summer months, it would appear the Spanish game was in rude health both on and off the pitch.","In Catalonia, Neymar has dominated attention after his 57 million euro ($74 million, £48.7 million) move from Santos to Barcelona was confirmed in June, whilst, in the capital, Real Madrid backed up their 69 million euro investment in the young Spanish duo of Isco and Asier Illarramendi with an on-going pursuit of the 100 million euro rated Gareth Bale in a saga that looks set to run well into the final days of the transfer window. But beneath the big two, the game in Spain has continued to reflect the general ailing Spanish economy with even clubs in the Champions League forced to sell their best players. As a result, the already colossal gap between Real and Barca and the rest continues to increase as do fears that by continuing to use an unbalanced TV deal that greatly favours the big two, La Liga descends further into a turgid two-horse race. However, whilst both Barca and Real have been active in the transfer market, there are concerns that both have so far failed to bring in the type of players they really needed after falling at the semi-final stage of the Champions League last season. Neymar's arrival should certainly ease the scoring burden that Lionel Messi has carried almost single-handedly for the past two seasons, but the Catalans still look very threadbare at the back with captain Carles Puyol having undergone two operations during the close season and not due back till at least September. Real meanwhile have bolstered an already strong midfield, but haven't so far replaced Gonzalo Higuain after he joined Napoli last month leaving only Karim Benzema and youngster Alvaro Morata to fill the lone striker's position. There is though already a great deal more calm around Los Blancos following the departure of Jose Mourinho with the management team of Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane highly-respected by the squad and the players themselves coming together as a unit following the public clashes and fallouts that marked the Portuguese's final season at the Bernabeu. That greater unity should mean Real push Barca a great deal closer than they did last season, but the title will again be defined by small margins. Such is their dominance that firstly Real and then Barca amassed 100 points in winning the title in the past two seasons and with the gap only set to widen between them and the rest, it is highly likely whoever becomes champions will need to register a century of points once more. In the battle for Champions League places, Atletico Madrid seem the best set despite losing star man Radamel Falcao to Monaco. Atletico have arguably done the best business in terms of value for money as they replaced the 60 million euro Colombian with David Villa for an inital fee of just 2.1 million euros. Continuing an uncharacteristic period of stability since Diego Simeone took charge of the club in December 2011, Atletico are only the only club to finish in the top six last season that haven't changed manager over the close season and they are heavy favourites to be the best of the rest once more. Further down, Valencia, Sevilla, Real Betis and Real Sociedad are all likely to be in the mix for the European places despite all losing key players in recent months. Valencia have replaced new Spurs signing Roberto Soldado with a former Spurs player, Helder Postiga, for a tenth of the price they sold Soldado, whilst Sevilla have also seen two Spanish internationals depart as Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo have joined Manchester City. However, they will still most likely battle it out for the final Champions League place as last season's surprise package Sociedad haven't invested heavily in their squad despite the 39 million euro windfall they received from Illarramendi's departure. Betis have lost their key creative lynchpin in Benat Extebarria after he rejoined Athletic Bilbao and the Basques themselves will be hoping for a far more successful campaign than their 12th-placed finish last season following the appointment of the highly-rated Ernesto Valverde as manager."
