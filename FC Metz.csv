0,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
1,17/09/2020,00:39,Draxler's late goal gives depleted PSG first Ligue 1 win of season,"Julian Draxler scored in added time on Wednesday night to give depleted Paris Saint-Germain their first league win of the season, 1-0 at home against Metz.","PSG, shorn of many stars before kick off, were playing with nine men when Draxler pounced on a rebound to nod home PSG's first goal of the league season. ""I'm very proud, it's incredible, honestly. I still have to think about it because I still can't believe it,"" PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said after the game. PSG, who started the game seriously depleted, were reduced to 10 men after 65 minutes when central defender Abdou Diallou collected a second yellow card and his club's fourth of the season. In the dying seconds, defender Juan Bernat, a 63rd minute replacement, limped off with a knee injury, leaving PSG, who had used all their replacements with nine men. ""All the fans can be proud, we still deserved to win, at 9 against 11,"" said Tuchel. While the game was in progress, the French league announced bans of two games for Neymar and Leandro Paredes and six games for Layvin Kurzawa after their red cards during a home loss to Marseille on Sunday that ended in a brawl. Another star attacker, Kylian Mbappe, remains in coronavirus quarantine while Thilo Kehrer and Marco Verratti are injured. But striker Mauro Icardi, centreback Marquinhos and goalie Keylor Navas returned after spells in quarantine. ""We made a lot of effort, we had a lot of changes, we used a lot of players who have not trained for a while...with players who haven't played for a long time,"" said Tuchel. ""But the effort is still there."" PSG had opened the season with two defeats for the first time since 1984/85, losing by one goal to Lens and then Marseille. They again dominated possession on Wednesday but lacked a cutting edge until Draxler pounced in the dying seconds and saved them from starting a season goalless in three goalless for the first time in their 50-year history. ""At 11 we missed all our chances, in the second half we were tired, it wasn't easy to create chances, at 10 we still had two great chances, we still miss, we don't score,"" said Tuchel. ""This team has shown once again that they have an extraordinary spirit."" Metz coach Vincent Hogon blamed his team. ""We ruined everything. If we lost tonight it's our fault, because we let in a goal at nine against 11,"" he said ""No, that's not allowed."""
