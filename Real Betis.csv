0,08/02/2021,14:20,"Bayern fume, Mbappe flies, Zlatan's milestone: European talking points","Bayern Munich's preparation for the Club World Cup was disrupted despite victory, Kylian Mbappe rediscovered his supersonic speed and Lionel Messi starred from the bench, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic notched his 500th club goal at the weekend.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Bayern Munich's weekend started well, Kingsley Coman's deflected strike securing a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Friday as they maintained a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga from RB Leipzig. They then boarded a plane for Qatar in preparation for a night flight to the Club World Cup, but the necessary de-icing of the aircraft meant they were refused permission for take-off due to a ban on flights between midnight and 7:00 am. That meant a departure seven hours later than planned, ruining plans to train on Saturday and hampering preparations for Monday's semi-final against Al Ahly. ""Those in charge (at the airport) don't have an inkling of what they've done to our team,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. ""Of course it was not optimal,"" said Joshua Kimmich. ""Nonetheless I think that we will be able to win the match."" It was what made Kylian Mbappe so breathtaking when he first broke through but it was something that had not been seen so often this season. On Sunday the France star produced a stunning sprint to finish off a counter-attack and score Paris Saint-Germain's opener in a 2-0 win at Marseille. Mbappe's run was clocked at an incredible 36 kilometres per hour, but he managed to slow down enough to control Angel di Maria's pass and score his 16th Ligue 1 goal this season, as PSG stayed third, three points behind leaders Lille. ""The feeling is coming back because I am playing every game now,"" said Mbappe, who was often on the bench in Thomas Tuchel's final matches in charge but has hardly missed a minute under new coach Mauricio Pochettino. ""I am finishing games stronger. I am not so burnt out. It can only be a good thing."" PSG's Champions League last 16, first leg in Barcelona is just eight days away. The last time Lionel Messi came off the bench in La Liga, he was introduced at half-time and scored twice in a 5-2 win over Betis. On Sunday he again came on as a substitute against Betis, this time in the 57th minute. Moments later he scored Barcelona's equaliser, and he then played a key part in their second before fellow substitute Francisco Trincao's late strike secured a 3-2 win. Messi was rested at the start along with Frenkie de Jong and Pedri, with coach Ronald Koeman appearing to prioritise Wednesday's Copa del Rey semi-final, first leg at Sevilla, and with the PSG Champions League tie approaching too. Barca, like Real Madrid, are seven points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who have two games in hand and play on Monday against Celta Vigo. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's brace was key in setting AC Milan on the way to a 4-0 win over Crotone that kept them two points clear of Inter atop Serie A, but it also saw the former Sweden striker reach a remarkable milestone. The goals were his 500th and 501st at club level since starting out with Malmo in 1999. Now 39, he is in his second spell with Milan and his hoping to win a second Scudetto with the Rossoneri, after starring in their 2011 title triumph. Ibrahimovic scored 14 goals that season and already has 14 this season, in just 11 appearances. Mesut Ozil made his second substitute appearance in five days for new club Fenerbahce but could not help turn Istanbul's Intercontinental derby, as Galatasaray headed back to the European side of the Bosphorus with a 1-0 win. Ozil had helped set up a goal in Fenerbahce's 2-1 win at Hatayspor last Wednesday. Against Galatasaray, the ex-Arsenal man came on for the last 27 minutes with Fenerbahce already trailing. It is shaping up to be quite a title run-in in Turkey, with Galatasaray, Besiktas and Fenerbahce all level on 48 points at the top."
1,07/02/2021,23:47,Super-sub Messi leads Barcelona comeback against Betis,Lionel Messi scored his fastest league goal as a substitute as his strike 136 seconds after coming on inspired Barcelona to a 3-2 victory over Real Betis on Sunday.,"Messi was among several key players rested, with Ronald Koeman seemingly prioritising Wednesday's Copa del Rey semi-final against Sevilla ahead of Barca's fading title challenge in La Liga. Defeat would have called that decision into question but Messi drove in an equaliser less than three minutes after coming on in the second half and then helped set up Francisco Trincao to score a late winner, the 21-year-old's first goal for Barcelona. ""He changed the game,"" said Koeman, when asked about Messi. ""It's a bit about the cup game but we also have to decide when the best moment is to rest players. The cup is the shortest route to a title this season."" Koeman's side sit seven points behind La Liga's leaders Atletico Madrid, who have played two games fewer and face Celta Vigo at home on Monday night. Success also came at a cost as Barca's best available central defender Ronald Araujo was forced off with an ankle injury early on. With Gerard Pique already a long-term absentee, Araujo's fitness will be a huge concern, especially with a Champions League last 16 first leg at home to Paris Saint-Germain to come, a week after the test against Sevilla. Betis will wonder how they managed not to take at least a point from a wild contest at the Benito Villamarin but Barcelona sustain their momentum, this their sixth league victory in a row. They were hit early by the injury to Araujo, whose ankle caved under the weight of an awkward fall. Frenkie de Jong came in at centre-back and his partner Clement Lenglet should have given Barca the lead but headed wide from five yards out with nobody near him. Betis made them pay with a brilliant opening goal on the break. Ousmane Dembele lost the ball upfield and Betis poured forward, the ball shifted right to Emerson who motored round Jordi Alba and squared for Borja Iglesias to slam home. Juanmi might have made it two but was denied by Marc-Andre ter Stegen before Messi came on for Miralem Pjanic in the 57th minute and equalised in the 59th. Dembele returned a pass to the Argentinian on the edge of the area and he drove a sizzling shot inside the post. Nine minutes later, Barca were in front, Alba's cross mishit by Antoine Griezmann, only for the ball to cannon in anyway off the legs of Victor Ruiz. Betis were not finished yet and neither was Ruiz, the defender making amends by heading in Nabil Fekir's crossed free-kick with 15 minutes left. Yet Barcelona had one more trick up their sleeve as Messi weaved in from the left and his chipped pass was headed into the path of the 21-year-old Trincao, whose thundering shot flew in off the crossbar."
2,27/01/2021,00:06,"Real Betis, Villarreal qualify for Copa del Rey quarter-finals","Borja Iglesias scored twice in extra time to send Real Betis through to the last eight of the Copa del Rey on Tuesday following a 3-1 win over Real Sociedad, joining Villarreal and Levante in the quarter-finals.","Real Sociedad took the lead in the first half courtesy of Mikel Oyarzabal but were reduced to 10 men just after the interval following the dismissal of Asier Illarramendi. Antonio Sanabria was then sent off for Betis shortly before Sergio Canales equalised, with Iglesias striking in both halves of extra time to eliminate Sociedad. La Real will play Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao in the final of the 2019-20 competition on April 4, after it was postponed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Villarreal edged past second-tier Girona 1-0 while Levante won 4-2 at Valladolid earlier on Tuesday. Lionel Messi will be available again after serving a two-match ban as Barcelona head to the capital to take on Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday. Athletic face Alcoyano, the third-division club that dumped out Real Madrid in the previous round, on Thursday."
3,07/11/2020,18:32,Super-sub Messi scores twice to lead Barca to Betis win,"Lionel Messi came on at half-time to rescue Barcelona by scoring twice, including his first goal from open play this season, in a 5-2 victory over Real Betis on Saturday.","Messi had been rested by Ronald Koeman but was thrown on with the game in the balance after Antoine Griezmann missed a penalty in the Argentinian's absence, before Antonio Sanabria cancelled out Ousmane Dembele's opener. But within four minutes of his introduction, Messi gave Griezmann an open goal with a superb dummy and then scored twice himself, the first a penalty that saw Betis' Aissa Mandi sent off for a handball on the line. In between, Loren Moron had given Betis brief hope but Messi's second and a late strike from Pedri ensured Barcelona ended their four-match winless run and climbed to eighth in La Liga. Koeman's assistant Alfred Schreuder said before the match Messi was ""not fresh"" but the 33-year-old gave a resounding answer to those suggesting his performances this season have been evidence of decline. Even before registering his first goal of the season from open play, Messi had turned this game, putting Barcelona in control with his brilliant dummy for Griezmann and then a penalty won from a Dembele shot, teed up by his pass. Griezmann also got his goal with Messi on the pitch but was unable to prove a point without him. Despite a lively opening half an hour, Griezmann missed a penalty before Messi scored his and the Frenchman was eventually substituted, pictured sat in the stands with a gloomy expression while Barca romped to victory. Neither team seemed too interested in defending early on as Griezmann and Ansu Fati fired off two shots each while Marc-Andre ter Stegen had to be alert to push away William Carvalho's header. Barca broke through after 22 minutes when Dembele cut inside onto his left foot before hammering a finish past Claudio Bravo for his first league goal in 13 months. When Mandi conceded a penalty after sliding in on Ansu at the front post, Griezmann had his chance to add a goal to his busy first-half display. But Griezmann missed, a tame shot easily saved by Bravo, before Betis scored, Sanabria finishing after Cristian Tello had again surged clear down the left. Messi came on and four minutes later Barca were ahead, the Argentinian scuttling to meet Jordi Alba's cross at the front post, only to step over the ball, fooling his marker and the goalkeeper, to leave Griezmann with an open net. Eleven minutes later, Messi made it 3-1 with a penalty, won after his pass had set up Dembele for a shot that was blocked on the line by the arm of Mandi, who was sent off. Moron gave Betis hope with 17 minutes left when he finished off Alex Moreno's pullback but Messi made sure, latching onto Sergi Roberto's flick and smashing in his second and Barca's fourth. Pedri made it five in injury-time."
4,06/11/2020,02:43,Barcelona look to stir from poor start in La Liga,"Barcelona have taken solace in the Champions League recently while getting off to their worst start to a La Liga season in almost two decades, leaving Ronald Koeman's side already under serious pressure before Saturday's meeting with Real Betis.","The Catalans have taken just eight points from their first six matches in La Liga, failing to win any of their last four outings after drawing 1-1 away at 10-man Alaves in the Basque Country last time out. It is their worst start since 2002/03, a campaign in which they finished sixth, and they are already nine points behind the leaders, Real Sociedad, albeit with two games in hand. Barca are also eight points adrift of reigning champions Real Madrid and they desperately need a result at home to Manuel Pellegrini's Betis with a trip to Atletico Madrid coming up next. ""The mood is better, there are new players, young players who are bringing dynamism to the group and the way we play,"" insisted Gerard Pique after Wednesday's 2-1 win over Dynamo Kiev, their third in three Champions League outings. The emergence of the likes of Ansu Fati, who turned 18 last weekend, and fellow teenager Pedri does point to a brighter future, but Barca remain mired in crisis off the field after the recent resignation of president Josep Maria Bartomeu. ""The club right now is how it is,"" Pique said. ""It's in a process of many changes which are necessary. We needed to turn things around. It was obvious that we were in decline and every year we were a little worse. ""We don't have much time, but we need it to improve. There's never a transition year at Barcelona, but now a new president and board will come in and we will see changes in the coming months."" In the meantime Koeman will also be hoping for Lionel Messi to show something more like his old form against Betis, as the Argentine is still looking for his first goal in open play this season. He has just one league goal so far, and leaving aside last season when he was injured at the beginning of the campaign, it is Messi's own worst start in front of goal in La Liga since 2005. Back then he was an 18-year-old just breaking through. Betis head to the Camp Nou in seventh place and their star man so far has been a former Barcelona player: Catalan-born winger Cristian Tello has four goals to his name including two in last week's win over Elche. After a shocking mistake by stand-in Neto gifted Alaves a goal last weekend, Marc-Andre ter Stegen made a welcome return between the posts for Barcelona against Dynamo Kiev. The German was making his first appearance of the season after a knee injury and starred as Barca beat the Ukrainians 2-1. Koeman will hope for more of the same from his number one in the weeks ahead. 100 - Sergio Ramos scored his 100th goal for Real Madrid against Inter in the Champions League in midweek, 55 with his head according to sports statisticians Opta. He has been at the club since 2005. 4 - Lionel Messi has scored four goals this season, all of them from the penalty spot. 17 - At 17 years and 338 days, Yunus Musah became Valencia's youngest goal-scorer in La Liga this century when he netted against Getafe last weekend. An England youth international, he was called up to the full United States squad this week. 22 - Atletico Madrid's current run of 22 games unbeaten is their best ever run without losing in La Liga."
5,23/10/2020,03:58,"Clasico, Dortmund v Schalke - what to look out for in Europe this weekend","Two of the biggest rivalries in world football will dominate the weekend's action in Europe, with the first Clasico of the season being followed by the Ruhr derby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke on Saturday.","AFP Sport previews the standout action on the continent this weekend: Barcelona v Real Madrid, Saturday 1400 GMT Once the undisputed greatest fixture in world football, the Clasico has lost much of its lustre. Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Andres Iniesta were among the superstars to move on from Real Madrid and Barcelona in recent years, and this year Gareth Bale and Luis Suarez departed too. Lionel Messi would have left as well, had Barcelona let him. Usually there would be 99,000 fans packed into the Camp Nou. This time, because of the coronavirus pandemic, there will be none. The huge global audience will remain, but it's a long time since these teams have been at such a collective low ebb. Barca are struggling to get back on their feet under new coach Ronald Koeman and lost 1-0 at Getafe last weekend. Real won La Liga last season but the last week gives a more accurate picture of where they stand: Zinedine Zidane's team lost 1-0 at home to Cadiz and then went down 3-2 to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. Madrid have lost just once in their last seven visits to the Camp Nou though. Borussia Dortmund v Schalke, Saturday 1630 GMT Another great fixture usually played before a huge crowd, only 300 fans will be allowed in to see Dortmund host Schalke, rather than the usual 80,000. These sides are fierce rivals and tensions are running extra high after Dortmund prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko, 15, received alleged death threats and racist abuse from Schalke fans after scoring a hat-trick in last Sunday's 3-2 win in an Under-19 derby. Dortmund, with Erling Braut Haaland leading the line, will be favourites to get the better of a struggling Schalke who lost 4-0 on their last visit in May. Schalke sacked coach David Wagner after their poor start this season followed a long winless run at the end of the last campaign. Manuel Baum has replaced him and got his first point last weekend against Union Berlin. Dortmund's 1-0 victory at Hoffenheim last weekend made it three wins out of four in the Bundesliga this season, but Lucien Favre's side lost 3-1 at Lazio in the Champions League in midweek. Atletico Madrid v Real Betis, Saturday 1900 GMT Atletico are hoping to take advantage of the struggles of Real Madrid and Barcelona to win a first La Liga title since 2014. The signing of Luis Suarez from Barcelona underlined their ambition, but they head into Saturday's home meeting with Betis on the rebound from their joint-worst defeat in Diego Simeone's nine years as coach in Wednesday's 4-0 loss at Bayern Munich. Manuel Pellegrini's Betis have been inconsistent so far but, with the likes of Nabil Fekir, Sergio Canales and the evergreen Joaquin, should not be underestimated. Lyon v Monaco, Sunday 2000 GMT Lyon and Monaco have been Champions League semi-finalists in recent seasons but are not in Europe at all in this campaign, so each is desperate to get back to the promised land. Lyon have started poorly in Ligue 1 with just two wins in seven but have kept hold of star men Memphis Depay and Houssem Aouar. Monaco have been inconsistent too under new coach Niko Kovac but in Wissam Ben Yedder they have one of Europe's most lethal marksmen. AC Milan v Roma, Monday 1945 GMT Milan put their perfect start to the Serie A campaign on the line when they welcome Roma to San Siro on Monday. The Rossoneri have won four out of four so far in the league with Zlatan Ibrahimovic in fine form, but Roma have some useful veterans of their own in attack in Edin Dzeko and Pedro and are also slowly building form."
6,18/10/2020,23:25,Real Sociedad go top to extend surprise start in La Liga,"Real Sociedad continued La Liga's unpredictable start to the season by going top of the table on Sunday, after a 3-0 win away at Real Betis.","Villarreal had temporarily claimed first place earlier in the day by beating Valencia 2-1 at la Ceramica but Real Sociedad's impressive victory put them ahead on goal difference. They are the sixth different team to lead La Liga after six rounds of fixtures so far, as Real Madrid gave up their place at the top of the pile after a surprise loss at home to Cadiz on Saturday. Barcelona were also beaten away at Getafe. Real Sociedad took advantage as Portu and Adnan Januzaj scored goals either side of Mikel Oyarzabal converting a penalty to consign Betis to a third defeat in four games under their new coach Manuel Pellegrini. They drop to sixth. Earlier, Dani Parejo came back to haunt Valencia by scoring the winner for Villarreal, against his former club. After making 363 appearances for Valencia, many of them as captain, Parejo was one of a handful of key players allowed to leave in the summer. His deflected shot in the 69th minute was a reminder of what they were missing as Villarreal held on to go one point above Real Madrid. Despite a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Barcelona last month, it has been an encouraging start for Unai Emery, who was appointed Villarreal coach in July. They have 11 points from their first six games. Valencia sit 12th, having won just once in their last five matches, with the future of coach Javi Gracia still uncertain. Gracia was critical of the club after Valencia sold the likes of Parejo and Francis Coquelin to Villarreal, as well as Rodrigo and Ferran Torres to Leeds and Manchester City, but failed to make a single addition in the summer transfer window. Emery was also once at Valencia and so was Villarreal's Paco Alcacer, who opened the scoring with a penalty before Goncalo Guedes levelled shortly before half-time. Yet Parejo had the last word, receiving a pass from Takefusa Kubo and curling in after his shot deflected off Mouctar Diakhaby. Kubo was then sent off in the 90th minute after coming on in the 64th."
7,28/01/2019,14:47,Betis stadium to host Copa del Rey final,"This season's Copa del Rey final will be plated at the Benito Villamarin home of Real Betis on Saturday May 25, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) announced on Monday.","The Seville club's ground, with a capacity of almost 61,000, was chosen ahead of Valencia's Mestalla home for the right to stage the game. Last year's final was played at Atletico Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano, where Barcelona beat Sevilla 5-0 to win the trophy for the fourth season in a row. It is the first time the venue for the final has been announced before the finalists are known. This season's competition is at the quarter-final stage, with the second legs due to be played this midweek. Betis are still in the tournament, having drawn 1-1 away to Espanyol in the first leg last week. It will be the fourth time that the Copa del Rey final has been played in Seville, but the first at the home of Betis, who are two-time winners of the trophy."
8,11/11/2018,23:24,"Barca suffer first league home defeat in two years, Real boost Solari hopes","Barcelona lost at home in La Liga for the first time in more than two years as Real Betis pulled off a stunning 4-3 victory on Sunday, despite Lionel Messi scoring twice on his return from injury.","Barca last endured a league defeat at the Camp Nou against Alaves in September 2016 but, following 42 games unbeaten, their run was ended by a brilliant, counter-attacking display from Betis. Three hours later, Real Madrid were putting the finishing touches to a 4-2 win away at Celta Vigo, a result expected to earn Santiago Solari an extension to his tenure as coach. Real have now posted four consecutive victories since Solari was put in temporary charge while the gap behind Barca has been reduced to four points. ""He has done excellently,"" Madrid club director Emilio Butragueno said afterwards. ""We are very happy with how things have gone."" On his future, Solari said: ""We'll see. I don't usually plan too far ahead but in principle, it´s my day off tomorrow."" Barca's shock defeat came despite a return for Messi, whose two goals, one from the penalty spot and another deep into injury-time, proved little more than consolations. ""We don't leave with the feeling Betis were the better team,"" coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""I don't want to take any credit away from our opponent but we could have countered them better."" It was the first time ever that Messi scored twice and Barcelona lost, but they stay top of the table, even if three clubs now lurk just one point behind. Atletico Madrid, whom they face at the Wanda Metropolitano after the international break, Sevilla and Alaves lead the chasing pack. Alaves beat Huesca 2-1 earlier on Sunday, while Sevilla won by the same scoreline at home to Espanyol, Wissam Ben Yedder prodding in an 89th-minute winner. ""Top of the table is fine, I won't deny it,"" Valverde said. ""It should also help us to realise it is never easy to win."" Betis' reward for beating Barca is to climb to 12th. Quique Setien's side may have pulled back on the sumptuous, attacking football that earned them a sixth-place finish last term but, in full flow, they remain one of Spain's most difficult opponents to stop. ""We have been a brave team in every way,"" former Spain international Joaquin said. ""Winning at the Camp Nou requires concentration and doing everything very well. We played a great game."" Betis seemed faster, sharper and hungrier while Barcelona's midfield was repeatedly carved open on the break. It took five passes for the opener, the last a first-time drive from William Carvalho to free Junior Firpo down the left. He weaved inside Sergi Roberto and struck hard into the net. Barca had chances but Betis were soon pouring forward again, with Junior's cross evading everyone except Giovani Lo Celso on the opposite flank. His cute cut-back picked out Joaquin, who stabbed in Betis' second. Arturo Vidal replaced the jaded Arthur Melo at half-time and, in the 68th minute, Barca pulled one back, with Jordi Alba tugged down by Cristian Tello, and Messi converting the penalty for his eighth league goal of the season. But the recovery stalled three minutes later as Marc-Andre ter Stegen let Lo Celso's shot slip through his fingers and drop into the far corner for 3-1. Barca were not done yet. Two substitutes combined for a second, Munir El Haddadi laying on Vidal but no sooner had the comeback begun again, it was halted. First, Ivan Rakitic was sent off, a second yellow card for a late challenge on Lo Celso, and then Sergio Canales tapped in Betis' fourth from Junior's cross. Messi added his second in injury-time but there was to be no more late drama. Madrid's win was more straightforward as Karim Benzema opened the scoring, a sublime touch and turn making space for a crisp finish into the corner. Benzema's shot then cannoned in off Gustavo Cabral before Hugo Mallo's sweet volley gave Celta hope. Sergio Ramos, however, chipped in a late penalty, Cabral was sent off for a second yellow card and Dani Ceballos wrapped up the points with a superb long-range strike. Brais Mendez scored a second for Celta in injury-time. The only blot for Solari was a spate of injuries which saw Casemiro, Sergio Reguilon and Nacho all forced off. Gareth Bale also took a knock to his left ankle in the first half but was able to continue."
9,08/11/2018,23:42,"Arsenal progress despite Sporting stalemate, Chelsea ease through","Arsenal booked a place in the Europa League knockout stage and extended their unbeaten run to 15 matches despite a 0-0 draw with Sporting Lisbon on Thursday, while Olivier Giroud's first goal of the season sent Chelsea through.","But Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck, given a rare start just hours after being named in Gareth Southgate's England squad, had to be stretchered down the tunnel with what looked a nasty ankle injury in the first half. Arsenal midfielders Matteo Guendouzi and Aaron Ramsey were both visibly upset after Welbeck, who is out of contract at the end of the campaign, went down after jumping to win a header. ""It is mentally challenging (playing after a teammate is injured) but sometimes it comes with the game, and Danny has had a lot of injuries,"" winger Alex Iwobi told BT Sport. ""We wish him the best and will keep on encouraging and motivating him to get back."" Unai Emery's Gunners were the better side for long periods at the Emirates against a team who have already had three different managers this term, but were forced to settle for a point despite Sporting being reduced to 10 men late on when former Barcelona centre-back Jeremy Mathieu was sent off. But Arsenal did secure a last-32 spot regardless, as Vorskla Poltava lost 1-0 at home to Azeri outfit Qarabag in the other Group E game. Chelsea made it four wins from four matches in Group L by edging out a spirited BATE Borisov 1-0 in Belarus. Giroud ended his 11-game goal drought this season by giving Chelsea a 53rd-minute lead, and the Premier League giants held on despite BATE striking the woodwork three times in the match. ""I was hoping to score soon because I came back late from the World Cup and I was lacking maybe a bit of efficiency and luck but you always need to keep working hard and keep the faith and that's what happened tonight,"" France striker Giroud told BT Sport. The Londoners moved six points clear of Hungarians Vidi at the top of the group and have not tasted defeat in 17 matches since losing the Community Shield to Manchester City in August. Steven Gerrard's Rangers saw their 11-game unbeaten run in this year's Europa League come to a dramatic end as they threw away the lead three times in a 4-3 defeat at Spartak Moscow. Both sides were the beneficiaries of comical own goals in a crazy first half which ended with Glenn Middleton putting the Scots 3-2 ahead, but Luiz Adriano and Sofiane Hanni both scored in the space of 71 seconds to snatch Spartak victory. Rangers are now level on points with Spartak in an incredibly tight Group G, one point behind leaders Villarreal after the Spaniards' goalless draw with Rapid Vienna in Austria. ""For me, football is about levels and, if you don't defend properly and you don't do the basics well enough, high-level players and high-level teams normally punish you and that was the case tonight,"" Gerrard told the Rangers website. Reigning Scottish champions Celtic gave themselves a lifeline in Group B, as Odsonne Edouard's 79th-minute strike saw them beat RB Leipzig 2-1 in their must-win clash at Parkhead. Salzburg, semi-finalists last season, qualified for the next round with a 5-2 thrashing of Rosenborg in the group's other match, as Japanese forward Takumi Minamino scored a hat-trick. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt reached the last 32 with their fourth win from as many group games by beating Apollon Limassol 3-2 in Cyprus, while Lazio joined them in progressing from Group H as goals from Marco Parolo and Joaquin Correa secured a 2-1 win over Marseille to eliminate last season's runners-up. AC Milan stayed just a point adrift of Group F leaders Real Betis after Suso's second-half equaliser grabbed a 1-1 draw in Spain. Record five-time winners Sevilla needed a late penalty from Ever Banega to claim a 3-2 victory at Akhisar Belediyespor, after having a man sent off, losing a two-goal lead and seeing the Turks miss a spot-kick of their own."
10,25/10/2018,21:36,Arsenal sink Sporting as Betis topple AC Milan,"Danny Welbeck pounced on a defensive lapse to snatch a 1-0 victory for Arsenal at Sporting Lisbon in the Europa League on Thursday, while seven-time European champions AC Milan crashed to a home defeat by Real Betis.","England forward Welbeck struck a 78th-minute winner in Portugal as he punished a mistake by former Liverpool defender Sebastian Coates to hand Arsenal a third win in three matches in Group E. Unai Emery's Gunners have now won 11 games in a row in all competitions -- the club's best run since 2007 -- and are on the verge of qualifying for the Europa League last 32. Gennaro Gattuso's Milan dropped their first points in Group F as goals from Antonio Sanabria and Giovani Lo Celso, on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, earned Betis a famous 2-1 win in Italy. Patrick Cutrone grabbed a consolation for Milan who finished the game with 10 men after Samuel Castillejo saw red for the hosts in injury time. Olympiakos beat Dudelange of Luxembourg 2-0 in the group's other fixture, while there was more misery for Brendan Rodgers and Scottish champions Celtic in Germany. Brazilian striker Matheus Cunha and Portugal winger Bruma, who scored against Scotland in a friendly this month, were both on target in the first half as RB Leipzig won 2-0. Salzburg picked up a third successive victory to stay top of Group B as Munas Dabbur netted twice in a 3-0 defeat of bottom side Rosenborg. Chelsea can take a large step towards the knockout phase when they host BATE Borisov of Belarus later, while Steven Gerrard's Rangers face Spartak Moscow in Glasgow."
11,07/10/2018,18:54,Correa winner against Betis sends Atletico top of La Liga,Atletico Madrid shot to the top of La Liga after Angel Correa's goal proved the winner in an untidy 1-0 win over Real Betis on Sunday.,"Atletico sat seven points behind Real Madrid and Barcelona after winning only one of their opening four league games but as their rivals have stumbled, Diego Simeone's side have sprung into form. Even if Barca return to the summit by beating Valencia later on Sunday, this was Atleti's fifth win in six in all competitions, with their only dropped points coming in a stalemate away to Real Madrid. ""We look at everything quietly and continue to improve,"" Simeone said. ""We have grown."" Simeone can take some of the credit too for this victory at the Wanda Metropolitano, after throwing on both Correa and Thomas Partey as substitutes in the second half. Thomas provided the assist. ""When the players respond, the coaches look better,"" Simeone said. ""The teams that challenge up the top of the table are there because of the players they can bring off the bench."" The contest was billed as a classic clash of styles, with Atletico's stubborn defence up against the free-flowing Real Betis, who lit up the league last season with their flurry of goals. It is testament to the threat they pose that opponents have become more cautious this season and Atletico were successful here in their strategy of absorb and counter-attack. ""A great coach once said, the best Plan B is always to do Plan A better,"" said Betis coach Quique Setien. They could also have gone top with a win, such is the scrunched nature of the top half, but instead Betis stay seventh. ""We have less points than our performances deserve,"" Setien added. Diego Costa was missing with a thigh injury, allowing Nikola Kalinic to make his first start since joining from AC Milan in August. There was a lack of width and clear thinking in the first half although Betis had the best chance early on. Loren Moron raced through a rare gap in the Atletico defence but the ball got stuck under his feet and he skewed wide. Atletico posed a threat on the break but repeatedly fluffed the final pass. Kalinic struck the post early in the second half after Aissa Mandi gave it away, before Rodrigo lashed a shot at Pau Lopez. Simeone flapped his arms to beckon the home crowd ane Atleti were finding their rhythm as Antoine Griezmann pulled back for Kalinic and then Correa fired across goal but neither Griezmann nor Diego Godin turned it in. Correa, on for the quiet Thomas Lemar, had made a difference with his direct running and he deserved his goal in the 74th minute. Thomas flicked it into his path and with no better option, the forward drove low into the bottom corner. Betis pushed in the latter stages but there was little hint of an equaliser. Atletico held on."
12,19/08/2018,00:25,"Messi, Coutinho get Barcelona off to winning start",Two goals from Lionel Messi either side of a Philippe Coutinho strike allowed Barcelona to start their defence of the Spanish title with a 3-0 win over Alaves at the Camp Nou on Saturday night.,"Wearing the captain's armband following the departure of Andres Iniesta to Japan, Messi stepped up to send a cheeky second-half free-kick under the jumping wall and into the net for the opener, and Barca's 6,000th La Liga goal. Coutinho, who had come off the bench, lashed in the second goal before Messi added gloss to the scoreline in stoppage time, with the clock having ticked past midnight in Catalonia. While they took their time to get going, it was an ideal opening result for Ernesto Valverde's side, who are hoping to once again see off the challenges of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the battle for the title. While Cristiano Ronaldo has left Real for Juventus, Messi remains as the figurehead at Barcelona and he won his 33rd trophy with the club in the Spanish Super Cup victory over Sevilla last weekend. The 31-year-old will be aiming to put behind him the desperate disappointment that was Argentina's World Cup campaign, and he was unlucky not to get a hat-trick here. Messi saw a free-kick crash back off the bar late in the first half after going over the wall, so when he was handed another chance from a similar position in the 64th minute, he changed tack. This time, 22 yards out, he surprised the jumping Alaves defenders by going underneath and giving Fernando Pacheco in goal no chance. He then sent another curling effort off the post soon after. Coutinho started the match on the bench alongside summer signings Arthur, Malcom, Clement Lenglet and Arturo Vidal. However, he was sent on at the start of the second half and his goal seven minutes from the end effectively killed the game. The Brazilian had just squandered one chance after being played in by Messi when he picked up a pass from compatriot Arthur before lashing in, ensuring victory on the opening weekend for Barca for the 10th consecutive season. Messi, the top scorer in La Liga last season, then controlled a ball into the box on his chest before slotting in his second and his team's third in stoppage time. After the departures of Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, Real play their first league game under new coach Julen Lopetegui on Sunday night when they entertain near neighbours Getafe. Last season's runners-up Atletico, fresh from beating Real 4-2 after extra time in the UEFA Super Cup in Tallinn in midweek, start at Valencia on Monday. Elsewhere on Saturday, former Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla played his first competitive game in almost two years following a nightmare time with injuries. The 77-times capped Spanish international, who is now 33, suffered a serious Achilles injury playing for Arsenal in the Champions League in October 2016. After eight operations, the little attacking midfielder suffered a serious infection in the tendon that almost led to an amputation. But he fought back and recently returned to Villarreal, seven years after his departure for Malaga. Cazorla started in Villarreal's season-opener at home to Real Sociedad, as his side took a first-half lead through Gerard Moreno. However, the visitors fought back to win 2-1 with goals from Willian Jose and Juanmi, giving the Basque club's new coach Asier Garitano the perfect start. The other winners so far on the opening weekend are Levante, who triumphed 3-0 at Betis on Friday."

""He will join the squad on 11 July for our pre-season."" According to the club, Adan played 165 matches for Real Betis since signing for the club in the 2014 winter transfer window."
14,22/04/2018,22:59,Atletico draw to leave Barcelona even closer to title,"Atletico Madrid warmed up for their Europa League clash with Arsenal by playing out a 0-0 draw with in-form Betis in La Liga on Sunday, a result that left Barcelona closer still to the Spanish title.","Antoine Griezmann was left out of the starting line-up by coach Diego Simeone and Atletico drew a second blank in four days, following their 3-0 defeat away at Real Sociedad on Thursday. Atletico remain second but with four games left they are 11 points behind unbeaten La Liga leaders Barcelona, who can clinch the title next weekend when they go to Deportivo. Barcelona won the Copa del Rey at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano with a 5-0 rout of Sevilla on Saturday, but there was decidedly less drama at the same stadium 24 hours later. Saul Niguez struck the woodwork for Atletico in the second half, not long after Cristian Tello had hit the post for Betis at the other end. Griezmann came off the bench just after the hour mark, but Simeone's side could not get the breakthrough and they are four points clear of third-placed Real Madrid, who have a game in hand having not played this weekend. Atletico head to London for their Europa League semi-final first leg against Arsenal on Thursday. Betis, meanwhile, consolidate their hold on fifth place after extending their unbeaten run to seven games. European football seems a certainty now for them next season. Elsewhere on Sunday, Las Palmas had their relegation from La Liga confirmed following an emphatic 4-0 defeat at home to Alaves. The club from Gran Canaria needed a win to keep alive their slim hopes of staying in Spain's top flight for a fourth straight season. However, they suffered a fifth successive defeat in front of a sparse crowd on a wet Sunday in the Canary Islands, with Barcelona loanee Munir El Haddadi's second-half brace having Alaves in control before Alvaro Medran and Ruben Sobrino added late goals. They are the second team to be relegated from La Liga after bottom club Malaga's fate was sealed in midweek."
15,18/02/2018,22:52,"Real Madrid win eight-goal thriller, Atletico keep up Barca chase",Man of the moment Marco Asensio scored twice and Cristiano Ronaldo was also on target as Real Madrid kept up the feel-good factor with a thrilling 5-3 victory at Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday night.,"Madrid had been 2-1 down at half-time in a fantastic game at the Benito Villamarin, but they came roaring back in the second half with Sergio Ramos, Asensio -- who had scored the opener - Ronaldo and Karim Benzema all finding the net. They survived a late Betis onslaught, and after their 3-1 Champions League last 16, first-leg win against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, this victory confirms that Zinedine Zidane's side are looking better in La Liga now too. They remain fourth, a huge 17 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, this was their fourth win in five league outings, and they are back to within a point of third-placed Valencia with a game in hand to come at Leganes in midweek. Asensio had come off the bench to set up the two late goals that allowed Real to beat PSG and he was rewarded with a start on Sunday in Seville, while Gareth Bale also came in as the likes of Benzema and Luka Modric dropped to the bench. Asensio duly headed Madrid into an 11th-minute lead after Antonio Adan had saved a Ronaldo shot, but Betis had won when the sides last met at the Santiago Bernabeu and they hit back brilliantly. Loren and Joaquin, the latter from a free-kick, both came close before Aissa Mandi headed in a Joaquin cross to make it 1-1 in the 33rd minute. It was 2-1 shortly after, as visiting defender Nacho could only help a Junior shot into his own net, and the home fans in the crowd of over 53,000 erupted. Real also saw Marcelo limp off in the first half -- a potentially worrying sign ahead of the PSG second leg -- but they recovered superbly after the restart. Ramos, whose Sevilla past always ensures a hot reception from the Betis fans, levelled with a bullet header from a Lucas Vazquez corner. Dani Carvajal then set up Asensio for his second and Real's third as the hour approached, and Ronaldo smashed in their fourth goal in the 65th minute. The Portuguese, supposedly in decline, has now scored 10 times in six games between league and Champions League. Betis may lack the consistency to properly contest a European place, but they do provide entertainment, and Cristian Tello set up fellow substitute Sergio Leon to make it 4-3 late on. Benzema, on from the bench, completed the scoring at the death with a goal that will boost his confidence. Earlier, Kevin Gameiro came off the bench in the second half to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as second-placed Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0. It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League trip to Chelsea. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Villarreal are sixth after a 1-1 draw at Espanyol, while Real Sociedad beat Levante 3-0."

""We will live six months without you but we're confident that you'll come back stronger,"" Betis wrote on Twitter. ""I will be away for some time but my strength will always be with my team-mates,"" Feddal wrote.

17,30/01/2018,13:09,Dortmund defender Bartra set for Betis,"Borussia Dortmund defender Marc Bartra, injured in last year's bomb attack on the team bus, is poised to sign for Real Betis, Spanish media suggested on Tuesday.","""Marc Bartra is about to be announced as a new player for Real Betis,"" Mundo Deportivo reported on its internet edition. According to the newspaper, the 27-year-old Spanish international will be joining on a loan deal with an option to buy. For sports daily Marca, the deal was initially intended to be a loan arrangement but has since evolved into ""a transfer"". AS said ex-Barcelona defender Bartra ""is only a few minor details"" away from becoming a Betis player. On Monday, Bartra was in a German court to testify in the trial of Sergei Wenergold, accused of the April 11, 2017 attack on the Dortmund bus. Bartra, who suffered a fractured wrist, told the court he had had nightmares since the traumatic event, which left him in hospital for five ""terrible"" days. He said the attack had ""changed my life"". Wenergold, a German-Russian, has admitted to remotely setting off three explosions in an elaborate bid to make a fortune on the stock market. Bartra began his career at Barcelona in 2011-12 but after struggling to get playing time alongside Gerard Pique and Javier Mascherano he left for Dortmund in 2016."
18,21/09/2017,00:13,Real Madrid beaten by Betis on Ronaldo return,Antonio Sanabria struck deep into stoppage time to hand Real Betis a shock 1-0 win away to Real Madrid on Wednesday as the European champions failed to score for the first time in 74 matches.,"Defeat leaves Real already seven points adrift of leaders Barcelona just five games into their defence of La Liga having failed to win in all three home games so far this season. Even the presence of Cristiano Ronaldo on his return from a five-match domestic ban couldn't break Betis' resistence as former Real goalkeeper Antonio Adan produced stunning saves from Isco, Toni Kroos and Gareth Bale. And Betis snatched all three points in the 93rd minute when Sanabria powered home a header from Antonio Barragan's cross. Ronaldo was recalled among three changes to the Madrid side from Sunday's 3-1 win at Real Sociedad as Zinedine Zidane named his strongest available side. However, it was the visitors who made the stronger start and should have gone in front when Sanabria's goalbound effort was cleared off the line by Dani Carvajal. Real grew slowly into the game as Luka Modric fired into the side-netting, whilst Ronaldo's low drive was well-handled by Adan. But it was Keylor Navas who was forced into the best save of the opening 45 minutes as he tipped Fabian Ruiz's rising driver over the bar Adan made another smart stop to deny Isco just before half-time and Betis had to resist an onslaught after the break. Ronaldo blazed wildly over from Bale's inch-perfect cross before Kroos forced Adan into another finger-tip stop. The former Madrid 'keeper's finest moment came in denying Bale in spectacular fashion 15 minutes from time, though, as the Welshman's backheeled volley was turned onto the post. Betis were the side to finally have the ball in the net as the game entered five minutes of stoppage time, but Sanabria had strayed offside as he turned home Andres Guardado's shot. However, they broke with purpose once more minutes later and this time Sarabia wasn't to be denied as he bulleted a header into the far corner. Earlier, Atletico Madrid celebrated being awarded the honour of hosting the Champions League final in 2019 with an impressive 2-1 win at Athletic Bilbao to move up to third. The visitors needed to rely on a brilliant penalty save from Jan Oblak to deny Aritz Aduriz just before half-time. Angel Correa opened the scoring 10 minutes into the second-half by finishing off a flowing move involving Antoine Griezmann and Saul Niguez. And Yannick Carrasco secured the three points with an angled finish from another Griezmann through ball 17 minutes from time before Raul Garcia netted a late consolation for the hosts. UEFA awarded their showpiece event for next season to Atletico's new Wanda Metropolitano earlier in the day. And the feel-good factor around Atletico following their 1-0 victory over Malaga to open their new 68,000 capacity home at the weekend continued with a commanding display in their fifth away trip in six games so far this season. ""It is another important step for the club. Hopefully on the field we can match the growth of the club,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. ""We are making an enormous effort. We have played five games away from home and the response has been positive."" Sevilla moved into second, two points behind Barca, as Jesus Navas scored the only goal of the game in a 1-0 win over Las Palmas. Alaves remain without a point or even a goal after five games as Luisinho's winner handed Deportivo la Coruna 1-0 win for their first victory of the season. Leganes stay in the top half after a 0-0 draw at home to Girona."
19,20/08/2017,23:00,Barca honour terror attack victims in Betis win,"Barcelona got their La Liga season off to a winning start on Sunday, beating Real Betis 2-0 at a emotional Camp Nou following a pair of terrorist attacks in Catalonia.","Twin vehicle attacks on Thursday killed 14 people and wounded around 120 in Barcelona's bustling Las Ramblas boulevard and the nearby seaside resort of Cambrils. A minute's silence was held before kick-off, whilst Barcelona players wore black armbands and shirts with 'Barcelona' replacing individual names on the back. ""What happened was terrible, we hope this stops now because we are not afraid,"" Barca winger Gerard Deulofeu, who set up both goals, told BeIN Sports Spain. ""This victory is for those affected."" The decision for the match to go ahead with increased security measures put in place was part of a desire to ""recover normality"" in the words of Catalonia's president Carles Puigdemont. A defiant attitude was on show in the stands, although in common with many matches against weaker opposition, the 99,000 capacity Camp Nou was far from full. After the attack some fans, especially tourists, returned their tickets, the club said without giving figures. ""Their money was refunded to everyone, the circumstances are special and understandable,"" a club spokesman said. Fans in the Barca singing section borrowed a line from the club's anthem in a banner that read: ""No one can ever break us,"" whilst chants of ""we are not afraid"" rang out after the minute's silence. ""We can't live with fear, which is exactly the mentality that these situations normally cause and people don't want to leave the house,"" said Vanessa Hano, 28, an American Barcelona resident. ""I thought there would be like a collective hysteria but I see everything is normal,"" added Sandra Lorenzo, 41, as she sold drinks next to the stadium. ""I have worked here for 25 years at every match. They are not going to make me stay at home."" Prior to the attacks, Barca had endured a difficult start to the season on the field as shorn of Neymar following his world record 222 million euro ($261 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain, the Catalans were swept aside 5-1 on aggregate by Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup. Coach Ernesto Valverde admitted on Saturday events in the past few days had put the club's problems into perspective. However, despite also missing the injured Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta, Barca rose to the challenge of raising the city's spirits with a dominant display. ""In the end you always have to move forward,"" said Valverde. ""Our idea was to be able to dedicate this victory to those affected."" With the mayor of Cambrils Cami Mendoza and chiefs of Catalonia's regional police force among those watching on, captain Lionel Messi led by example with Deolofeu and Paco Alcacer struggling to fill Suarez and Neymar's shoes up front. Messi smashed an early free-kick off the post and his presence was enough to pressure Alin Tosca to turn Deulofeu's low cross into his own net for the opener nine minutes before half-time. Deulofeu was the provider once more when Barca doubled their advantage three minutes later as Sergi Roberto slotted home from close range. Messi also posed the biggest threat of a low key second-half as he struck the woodwork twice more with rasping shots from outside the area."
20,15/08/2017,09:27,Javi Garcia leaves Zenit for Real Betis,"La Liga side Real Betis have secured the signing of Spanish international midfielder Javi Garcia from Zenit St Petersburg, the Russian club announced on Monday.","Local media reported that Betis paid a fee of 1.5 million euros ($1.8m) for the 30-year-old, who won two international caps between 2012-2013. Garcia joined Zenit three years ago in a 17 million-euro move from Manchester City, and won the 2014-15 Russian league title and the 2016 Russian Cup. He becomes new Betis coach Quique Setien's ninth signing since taking over in May, joining the likes of former Barcelona winger Cristian Tello and fellow midfielders Victor Camarasa and Andres Guardado in moving to Seville. They have notably lost Spain under-21 star Dani Ceballos, with the midfielder moving to Real Madrid for 16.5 million euros."
21,09/08/2017,15:25,Real Betis clinch deal for Algerian Boudebouz,"Spanish side Real Betis have signed Algerian international attacking midfielder Ryad Boudebouz from Ligue 1 outfit Montpellier, the French club announced on Wednesday.","The 27-year-old has penned a four-year deal with the Seville-based team, who paid Montpellier seven million euros ($8.22m) for his services. Boudebouz, who previously played for Sochaux and Bastia, scored 11 goals and made nine assists in the French top flight last season. He has 24 international caps, having made his Algeria debut in 2010. Real Betis finished 15th in La Liga last term, but new head coach Quique Setien has bolstered his squad significantly since taking over in May after a successful spell in charge of Las Palmas. Boudebouz is Setien's eighth signing of the close season, joining the likes of former Barcelona winger Cristian Tello, midfielders Victor Camarasa and Andres Guardado, as well as former Swansea City defender Jordi Amat, in moving to the Benito Villamarin."
22,30/04/2016,22:35,Barca beat Betis to remain top,Barcelona remain on top of La Liga with two games remaining as goals from Ivan Rakitic and Luis Suarez earned a 2-0 win over 10-man Real Betis on Saturday.,"On a day of high tension when all three title contenders were at one point top of the table, Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to score the winner in Atletico Madrid's 1-0 win over Rayo Vallecano to remain behind Barca solely due to their inferior head-to-head record. Gareth Bale's thunderous header 10 minutes from time kept an under-strength Real Madrid just a point behind the leaders in third in a 1-0 victory at Real Sociedad. Barca need to win their two remaining games at home to Espanyol and away to Granada to be assured of retaining their title and were given a huge helping hand by Betis despite an unconvincing performance. Heiko Westermann was deservedly sent-off 10 minutes before half-time when he chopped down Rakitic to see his second yellow card in seven minutes. Rakitic took advantage of more Betis generosity five minutes after half-time when he was left with the simple task to slotting into an empty net after German Pezzella and goalkeeper Antonio Adan failed to cut out Lionel Messi's cross. Suarez fired straight at Adan when gifted a golden chance by Messi to seal the points 17 minutes from time. However, the Uruguayan made amends from another sensational Messi through ball eight minutes later to register his 54th goal of the season. In San Sebastian, Bale inspired a Real Madrid side without the injured Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema to a 10th straight La Liga win. ""I am happy for him because he has had problems this season with injury, but when is fit you notice,"" Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane said of Bale. ""We could have scored earlier in the first-half, but we had to work until the end against a difficult side. ""I am happy with the performance and to get three points once again."" As well as the absent Ronaldo and Benzema, Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane rested Marcelo, Dani Carvajal and Toni Kroos with one eye on the return leg of their Champions League semi-final against Manchester City on Wednesday. Bale was a constant threat in the air as he twice saw powerful headers fly just wide as Madrid completely dominated the hosts before the break. The visitors continued to press after the break, but Geronimo Rulli looked set to end their title hopes as the Argentine made a brilliant save to deny Bale from another fine Rodriguez cross. Yet, a week after leading Real back from a two-goal deficit at Rayo Vallecano, Bale made the difference again when he got across his marker to bullet home a header from Lucas Vazquez's cross. Atletico boss Diego Simeone also showed his priorities lie with the second leg of their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich in midweek as he made seven changes to the side that beat the German champions 1-0 on Wednesday. However, Atletico's youngsters struggled for the opening 55 minutes until Griezmann rode to the rescue. The French international made a sensational and instant impact after coming off the bench as he controlled a loose ball on the edge of the area before thrashing a volley into the bottom corner for his 30th goal of the season. And despite a late Rayo onslaught, Atletico held out to record their 34th clean sheet of the season. ""The important thing was to win and on a personal level I'm happy to score the goal,"" Griezmann told Movistar+. ""Now we need to rest. We have a great game to come on Tuesday and we'll try to get a good result there to go through to the final."""
23,02/04/2016,17:57,Five-star Atletico close gap on Barca,Antoine Griezmann struck twice as Atletico Madrid moved to within six points of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a comprehensive 5-1 win over Real Betis on Saturday.,"Barca host Real Madrid in what is set to be an emotional Clasico later as the Catalan giants pay homage to legendary former player and coach Johan Cruyff, who died last week at the age of 68. Atletico and Barca also meet at the Camp Nou in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday and Diego Simeone's men will travel with plenty of confidence after one of their most complete performances of the season. Fernando Torres opened the scoring with a lovely dinked finish reminiscent of his winner for Spain in the Euro 2008 final over Germany after racing onto Koke's fine through ball nine minutes before half-time. Griezmann doubled Atletico's advantage five minutes later thanks to a huge error from Betis 'keeper Antonio Adan as the French international's scooped pass into Koke's path slipped through his legs and rolled into the net. Adan made amends with great saves from Torres and Griezmann as Atletico threatened to run riot before the break. Right-back Juanfran was Atletico's hero with the winning penalty in a marathon shootout against PSV Eindhoven to reach the last eight of the Champions League last month. And the Spanish international netted his first goal from open play for nearly three years when he slammed home Angel Correa's fine cross just after the hour mark. Jan Oblak looked well on course to register a 20th clean sheet in 31 Liga games this season, but a rare slip from the Slovenian goalkeeper presented the ball at Ruben Castro's feet to slam home his 16th goal of the season and reduce Betis' deficit. Yet, Atletico took just three minutes to restore their three-goal lead as more great and unselfish work from Correa teed up Griezmann to fire home his 26th goal of the season despite Adan's best efforts. And Griezmann turned provider in stoppage time when he squared for substitute Thomas Partey to round off the scoring."
24,04/02/2016,22:07,Betis sign ex-Brazilian international Damiao,"La Liga strugglers Real Betis have bolstered their attacking options by signing former Brazilian international Leandro Damiao on a free transfer, the club confirmed on Thursday.","The 26-year-old has signed a five-month deal after being released by Brazilian side Cruzeiro in December. Betis haven't won in nine La Liga games and sit just two points above the relegation zone in 14th. Damiao scored three times in 18 international appearances with Brazil, but hasn't featured for the Selecao since 2013 after unsuccessful spells with Santos and Cruzeiro."
25,01/02/2016,19:09,Barca full-back Montoya joins Betis,"Barcelona right-back Martin Montoya has joined Real Betis on loan till the end of the season, the European champions confirmed on Monday.","Montoya had been on loan at Inter Milan, but that deal has now been cut short to allow him to join La Liga strugglers Betis. ""Barcelona and Betis have reached an agreement for the loan of Martin Montoya until June 30, 2016, rescinding the contract in place with Inter Milan,"" Barca said. Montoya, 24, won two league titles with Barcelona after coming through the club's famed youth academy, but failed to dislodge Dani Alves as the club's first-choice right-back. He made just four appearances since joining Inter last July."
26,16/12/2015,00:47,"Sevilla, Espanyol, Betis, Deportivo into Cup last 16","Sevilla, Espanyol, Real Betis and Deportivo La Coruna all advanced to the last 16 of the Copa Del Rey on Tuesday to join already-qualified Barcelona and Cadiz.","Deportivo held on for a 1-1 draw against second division Llagostera in their fourth round, second leg tie in Galicia for a 3-2 aggregate victory. Real Betis, 2-0 winners at home, were 3-1 down at Sporting Gijon in northern Spain before coming back to draw 3-3, and go through 5-3 on aggregate. Sevilla already had one foot into the last 16 after their 3-0 away win and easily advanced on front of their home crowd with a 2-0 success over Logrones. Espanyol, meanwhile, got off to a winning start under new Romanian coach Constantin Galca, coming back from a goal down to win 2-1, and advance 3-2 on aggregate. Holders Barcelona have already assured their place in the last 16 with a 6-1 thrashing of Villanovense. Real Madrid's expulsion from the competition for fielding an ineligible player against Cadiz, allowed the third division side to advance. Gary Neville has a great chance to seal his first win as Valencia boss at the third attempt when Los Che host third tier Barakaldo at the Mestalla on Wednesday. Valencia already lead the Basques 3-1 from the first leg before Neville's appointment a fortnight ago."
27,28/08/2015,02:24,Benitez seeks first Madrid win on Bernabeu bow,Real Madrid will be looking to put a disappointing start to Rafael Benitez's reign in charge behind them when Real Betis visit the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.,"Benitez's men could only manage a 0-0 draw away to newly promoted Sporting Gijon to start their league campaign last weekend, which already leaves them trailing Barcelona and Atletico Madrid by two points. A good start was seen as key to Madrid's bid to win just a second La Liga title in eight years with Barca and Atletico facing on paper a much harder start to the campaign. However, Real defender Nacho insists Los Blancos can't let panic set in just one game into the season. ""We need to be calm. At Real Madrid every game is a final,"" he told the club's website. ""If we had won against Sporting, we would still need to beat Betis. ""From remaining calm we can go out to win every game."" Madrid should be boosted by the return of Karim Benzema up front from a thigh injury after he returned to training on Tuesday. Gareth Bale is also expected to be fit despite suffering a foot injury in Gijon and James Rodriguez is likely to come into the starting line-up after he was surprisingly left on the bench last time out in favour of Isco. Barcelona made a perfect start to the defence of their title despite being under-manned as they gained revenge over Athletic Bilbao for their defeat in the Spanish Super Cup with a 1-0 win at the new San Mames. Luis Suarez grabbed the only goal of the game to ensure Lionel Messi wasn't made to pay for his first-half penalty miss and the South American duo could be reunited with Neymar for the first time this season when Malaga visit the Camp Nou on Saturday. The Brazilian has missed Barca's four competitive games to date due to a bout of the mumps, but has trained all week and will boost a Barca squad still without a number of key players. Gerard Pique serves the second of a four-game suspension, whilst Dani Alves has been ruled out for a month with an abductor injury. Malaga stunned the Catalans last season with a 1-0 win at the Camp Nou, which interrupted a 20-match winning run. ""Going there and winning was important, but that is now last season. We are in a new campaign with new players and it is going to be a completely different game,"" Malaga defender Roberto Rosales told the club's website. ""Logically, Barcelona at home are the favourites, but we will try to ensure that doesn't happen using the strengths we have."" The game of the weekend comes at the Sanchez Pizjuan as Sevilla host Atletico Madrid in the first clash between Spain's five Champions League representatives of the season. Atletico have been tipped to once again challenge Barca and Real for the title this season, but were unconvincing in their 1-0 win over Las Palmas last weekend. Sevilla were lucky to escape with a 0-0 draw at Malaga after having Steven N'Zonzi sent-off on his debut, but the Andalusians could hand a debut to Fernando Llorente after he sealed his move from Juventus on Thursday. Valencia will also be keen to get their first La Liga win of the campaign when they host Deportivo la Coruna after sealing a place in the Champions League group stages for the first time in three years with victory over Monaco in midweek. Meanwhile, the early leaders Eibar will attempt to extend their perfect record when the minnows host Athletic Bilbao in a Basque derby on Sunday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

29,11/02/2015,02:20,Fans rally for Irish coaching legend 'Don Patricio',"An unmarked grave in London is all that is left to remember an Irish football coach cherished by British, Irish and Spanish supporters who are grouping together to raise funds for a new memorial.","The man known as 'Don Patricio' to a legion of Real Betis and Barcelona fans was born Patrick O'Connell in 1887 and went on to coach Barca during the Spanish Civil War -- the toughest period in the club's history. O'Connell's story is one of extremes. At the dawn of professional football, he achieved glory but abandoned a family in Ireland, formed a new one in Spain, and died poor in London in 1959. ""Patrick O'Connell was, in my opinion, an enigma. He had brilliant success in his career, but always had a dark side,"" Mike O'Connell, his grandson, told AFP. The coach lived out his final years at his brother's home in London after spending three decades in Spain, where he worked for Racing Santander, Real Oviedo, Real Betis, Barcelona and Sevilla. He is better remembered in Spain than in Ireland or Britain, where he is buried in St Mary's Cemetery in a dilapidated tomb in west London. Decades after his death, fans have joined forces to restore the tomb and build him a monument in Belfast in Northern Ireland, where he got a start in club football playing for Belfast Celtic. O'Connell went on to become the first Irish player to captain English giants Manchester United. He also played for the Irish national team, winning the British Home Championship of 1914, before Ireland's independence from Britain in 1916. ""We hope that this campaign will both raise awareness and also build a memorial befitting his football achievements,"" said Fergus Dowd, an Irishman and one of the organisers of the Patrick O'Connell Fund (www.pocfund.com). Dowd and his fellow campaigners get shirts signed by major players past and present -- Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Paolo Maldini and Andrea Pirlo, among others -- and auction them. His idea is to celebrate an event in each city linked to O'Connell's career. Real Betis, now in Spain's second division, have been heavily involved. The Seville club paid tribute to their former coach in December in a match against Racing Santander, 80 years after a 5-0 win against the same team won Betis the league title. ""Betis fans know who O'Connell is,"" said Julio Jimenez Heras, communications director for the club. ""The new generations of fans do not remember players from that team, but they know who O'Connell was. ""He was a man who liked the streets, who grew fond of the city. He had a very nice phrase about Seville -- the city 'where people live as if they were to die tonight'"". In 1935, O'Connell took the reins of Barcelona, signed by club president Josep Sunol. ""The Civil War surprised O'Connell as head of the team, with whom he toured throughout the Americas, and at the end of the war he was ostracised by the Francoist authorities,"" Barcelona say on their website. Most of the players stayed in Mexico and the United States, but O'Connell returned and coached the team until 1940. By then he had stopped sending money to his Irish family, who had not heard from him in a long time. On June 12, 1949, Spain played in Dublin, said Sue O'Connell, the wife of his grandson, Mike. His son Daniel ""went to visit the Spaniards after the game, pretending to be a distant relative, and asked for him"", she added. They knew him and told him that he lived in Seville. ""Times were hard in 1950. Daniel took a year to save money and went to Spain, to Seville,"" said Sue, who is looking to publish a book that she has written about her husband's grandfather. ""He found his father. But they did not get along... Although afterwards Dan joked, it hurt him."" O'Connell never divorced but got married again in Spain to an Irish woman. Descendants of his first family said they were ""proud"" of their relative. Remembering family meals, Sue said: ""It was strange, because he was not there, but they could not stop talking about it."""

""Cedrick is a young, versatile player with international experience who can make an impact at any of our four attacking positions,"" Crew coach Gregg Berhalter said. Mabwati netted 13 goals in four seasons in Spain, including nine in the 2010-2011 campaign. He joins Argentina's fellow forward Frederico Higuain in the Columbus attack. The Crew finished third in the MLS Eastern Conference last season, winning 14 and drawing 10 from 34 league contests. Columbus, whose only MLS title came in 2008, lost to eventual champion New England in last season's playoffs."
31,18/05/2014,22:26,Football: Osasuna relegated amidst barrier collapse chaos,"Osasuna and Valladolid were relegated to the Spanish second division on Sunday, but the final round of La Liga matches was overshadowed by the collapse of a barrier which injured 58 fans at Osasuna's El Sadar stadium in Pamplona.","The Navarran Red Cross confirmed 10 people, including children, were taken to hospital and a further 48 suffered minor injuries when the barrier gave way under the pressure of fans surging forward after Oriol Riera had given Osasuna the lead against already-relegated Real Betis. A number of spectators had to be carried to safety on stretchers with the players helping to lift them to safety. ""Many thanks to the Osasuna staff, security team, fans and a number of people that have collaborated with the work of our volunteers,"" the Navarran Red Cross added on their official Twitter page. The match was suspended for 35 minutes whilst the area was secured and the second halves in three other matches affecting the fight against relegation were also delayed so that all four finished at the same time. Once play got back underway Osasuna went on to win 2-1, but it wasn't enough to extend their 14-year stay in the Primera Division as Granada's 1-0 victory at Valladolid thanks to Stefan Mitrovic's own-goal condemned both sides to the drop. ""It is a very sad day personally and professionally for me,"" said Osasuna boss Javi Gracia. ""I am very sorry that the team has been relegated. I am sorry for the situation we have come to and I hope Osasuna will be back in the Primera as soon as possible. ""Despite winning, we didn't have it in our own hands and the results didn't go our way. At this time any analysis of the game and the situation has no meaning for me given the moment in which the team, the club and everyone is experiencing."" Betis manager Gabriel Humberto Calderon, meanwhile, criticised the stadium's state of repair. ""It had been many years since I had been to El Sadar. I was surprised by the state of the stadium in 2014 and the politicans need to do something to have a stadium that belongs to 2014 and Osasuna,"" he said. There was also disappointment for Valladolid as, despite taking points from both Barcelona and Real Madrid this season, they return to the Segunda after just two seasons in the top flight. ""I ask for the forgiveness of the club and the fans, I have not met the task handed to me when the club signed me last summer,"" said Valladolid boss Juan Ignacio Martinez. ""It is clear that I am the most responsible, but I keep my head held high because my behaviour and honour has been irreproachable."" Getafe ensured their safety as two goals from Ciprian Marica handed them a 2-1 victory at Rayo Vallecano, whilst a point was enough for Almeria as they drew 0-0 at home to Athletic Bilbao."

47,18/01/2014,18:21,"Football: Ronaldo, Bale on target as Madrid move joint top",Real Madrid moved level on points with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga with a 5-0 hammering of bottom-placed Real Betis on Saturday.,"Cristiano Ronaldo continued his fantastic week after lifting the Ballon d'Or on Monday with a thumping long-range drive to open the scoring before Gareth Bale silenced his recent critics with a trademark free-kick to make it 2-0. Karim Benzema then notched his 100th goal for Madrid in first-half stoppage time as he blasted home after classy play from Luka Modric. Angel di Maria made it four just after the hour mark with another stunning effort from distance and Alvaro Morata rounded off the scoring in stoppage time. All three leading clubs are now tied on 50 points, but Barca and Atletico can move back in front when then face Levante and Sevilla respectively on Sunday. Bale had struggled since his return from a calf injury at the beginning of the year with coach Carlo Ancelotti even admitting on Friday that the Welshman could do better. But the Italian praised the former Spurs man's display as his side produced their best display of the year to date. ""Bale played well, as did the whole team. We played with great quality and concentration throughout the game,"" he said. ""Everything went well and therefore we have to be happy. ""It was an important opportunity for us to go to the top of the table and we can sleep well tonight."" It was once again Ronaldo who stole the show early on as he opened the scoring 10 minutes in with a thunderous drive from 25 yards out that flew into the top left-hand corner of Stephan Andersen's net. Ronaldo nearly had another memorable goal to add to his collection 10 minutes later as he skipped past two Betis defenders before firing across the face of the goal. The visitors didn't have to wait long to double their advantage, though, as Bale did make his mark with a dipping free-kick on 25 minutes that beat the stationary Andersen, although the Danish keeper should have done better. Ruben Castro missed a wonderful opportunity to pull a goal back for the hosts when he failed to connect with Leo Baptistao's fine low cross six minutes before half-time. Instead, it was Madrid who struck again before the break as Modric continued his fantastic form of late with a wonderful piece of composed play inside the box to tee up Benzema to fire home at the near post. Andersen redeemed himself somewhat at the start of the second period as he made a fine low save to his right to prevent Ronaldo doubling his tally and also turned away a fiercely struck effort from Benzema. However, there was nothing the Betis keeper could do to prevent Di Maria making it four as he arrowed a low left-footed drive from 30 yards into the bottom corner. And Betis's afternoon was summed up in stoppage time when Morata nipped in to prod past Andersen as the home defence appealed in vain for offside."

53,15/12/2013,23:00,Football: Costa double takes Atletico level with Barca,Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona at the top of La Liga as a double from Diego Costa guided them to a 3-0 win over Valencia on Sunday.,"After a disappointing first-half, Costa opened the scoring in style with a stunning individual effort 14 minutes after the restart. Just four minutes later substitute Raul Garcia rattled home a loose ball inside the area to seal the three points. Costa then saw a penalty saved by Diego Alves, but made no mistake when handed a second opportunity from the spot six minutes later to move level with Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga's top scorer on 17. Both Atletico and Barca, on 43 points from 16 games, now have a five-point lead over Real Madrid after Los Blancos could only manage a 2-2 draw at Osasuna on Saturday. Atletico boss Diego Simeone made seven changes from the side that started in the 2-0 Champions League win over Porto in midweek as he resorted to his strongest available line-up. However, the hosts still found it hard going in the opening 45 minutes as Valencia controlled possession without posing a threat to Thibaut Courtois's goal. Atletico started the second period with far more urgency and after Tiago had turned Miranda's cross just wide, Costa ran half the length of the field before finishing low past Alves. Garcia then came on to replace David Villa and with virtually his first involvement in the game he made it 2-0 with an accurate drive into the far corner from inside the area. Costa's direct running was causing the Valencia defence all sorts of problems and he had the chance to make it three when he was pulled down by Victor Ruiz inside the area 15 minutes from time. But Alves dived to his right to turn away the resulting penalty -- the third time Costa has missed from the spot already this season. Costa wasn't to be denied a second time, though, as after he had been felled by Antonio Barragan, he blasted high past the helpless Alves. Earlier, Athletic Bilbao strengthened their position in fourth place with a 1-1 draw away to Sevilla. Alberto Moreno fired the hosts in front after four minutes only for Markel Susaeta to level two minutes later. Susaeta also saw a first-half penalty saved by Beto, but in the end Athletic were happy to settle for the point which moves them two clear of fifth-placed Villarreal. Real Sociedad moved to within four points of their Basque neighbours Athletic as they hammered bottom of the table Real Betis 5-1 at Anoeta. Imanol Agirretxe scored twice, whilst Antoine Griezmann, Ion Ansotegi and Xabi Prieto were also on target as Sociedad recorded their third straight league win. And Almeria moved out of the relegation zone with a 0-0 draw at home to Espanyol."

56,29/11/2013,02:10,Football: Beaten Barca looking for response in Bilbao,Midfielder Xavi Hernandez believes Barcelona have to recover the intensity in their play if they are to avoid a first league defeat of the season when they travel to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.,"The Catalans were beaten for the first time in 21 games since Gerardo Martino took charge in July on Tuesday as they produced an insipid display in going down 2-1 to Ajax in Amsterdam in the Champions League. Defeat was the first sign that Barca could be missing the influence of the injured Lionel Messi and Victor Valdes, but Xavi insisted those that are available have to show the right attitude when they face Athletic. ""They are important players and you are going to miss them, but that wasn't the principal reason for the defeat. We didn't do enough to win. ""We need to have intensity from the start and in San Mames it will be another test. ""We need to turn it around and go for it from the off with that intensity that we lacked (against Ajax)."" Barca are likely to also be without full-backs Adriano, Jordi Alba and Dani Alves on Sunday, but Sergio Busquets and Alexis Sanchez will return after being rested in midweek. Athletic have had an impressive start to the campaign themselves as Monday's 2-1 win over Malaga moved them to within a point of Villarreal in the final Champions League spot. Ernesto Valverde's side are unbeaten at home since the opening of the new San Mames in September with four wins and two draws from six games at their new stadium. The visit of the league leaders will prove their biggest test to date, but striker Aritz Aduriz is hoping they can take advantage of Barca's series of injuries. ""They are very important players for them. We will see if we are capable of taking advantage of it, although the other players have all it takes to replace them,"" he told sports daily Marca. ""To me they seem just as good as always. Until now they have won almost every game. Their level is just as good if not better than in previous seasons."" Real Madrid have the chance to cut their gap to Barcelona to three points for 24 hours at least when they host Valladolid on Saturday. Carlo Ancelotti's men continued their free-scoring form with a 4-1 destruction of Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday despite playing the majority of the match with just 10 men. Madrid have now scored 26 times in their last six games at home and in Europe and could be boosted by the return of Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese missed Wednesday's game due to a slight muscle strain, but Ancelotti confirmed that the player himself is confident he will be fit in time to face Valladolid. And even if La Liga's top scorer doesn't make it, Valladolid boss Juan Ignacio Martinez is aware of the daunting task facing his side. ""It is very difficult to get anything there because they are very good and, moreover, they have gained a lot since the return of Xabi Alonso,"" he said. ""We will try to compete well and hopefully remove the bad taste in our mouth we had after defeat in the last game against Osasuna."" Second-placed Atletico Madrid are also in action on Saturday away to Elche as they too can put the pressure on Barcelona by moving level on points with the Catalans. Diego Simeone will recall a number of first team regulars, including Diego Costa and David Villa, having left six players back in Madrid to rest while the remainder of his squad travelled to Russia for a 1-1 draw with Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League in midweek.

58,22/11/2013,02:15,"Football: Barca begin vital run without Messi, Valdes",Injury-ravaged Barcelona could be without seven first-team players as they look to consolidate their position at the top of La Liga at home to Granada on Saturday.,"The Catalans will begin a run of eight games across three competitions before Christmas without four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi after he tore his left hamstring in Barca's last outing away to Real Betis a fortnight ago. Barca's injury crisis has deepened since then as goalkeeper Victor Valdes will also miss the rest of the year after rupturing a calf muscle in Spain's 1-0 friendly defeat to South Africa in midweek. Right-back Dani Alves also returned from international duty with a calf problem that will see him sidelined for up to 10 days, whilst Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas and Xavi Hernandez are doubts and Jordi Alba remains out injured. Valdes' absence means that 38-year-old stopper Jose Manuel Pinto will start in goal for the next six weeks. And defender Javier Mascherano is confident Pinto's experience will be key in deputising for the on-form Valdes. ""The injuries to Victor and Leo are very important, but every player is able to play,"" he said on Thursday. ""The squad is very big. Valdes is important for what he represents and for the excellent level he has had until now. But we have to support Pinto, he has always responded when he has needed to. ""He is a keeper with a lot of experience. We cannot forget that he has won two Copa del Reys and had very good performances."" With such a raft of injuries, coach Gerardo Martino may be forced to hand 21-year-old Sergi Roberto his first start of the season in midfield. Neymar, meanwhile, will carry the significant burden of compensating for the loss of Messi in attack. Should Barca slip up at the Camp Nou on league duty for the first time in over a year, Real Madrid will be confident of cutting their six-point deficit on the leaders when they travel to Almeria. Los Blancos will be able to unleash the on-fire Cristiano Ronaldo fresh from his hat-trick that sealed Portugal's place in the World Cup with a 3-2 win over Sweden in midweek. ""It has been a very intense few days with our national teams, but we have two days in front of us to prepare in the best way possible for the next game,"" Ronaldo told Madrid's website. ""My only goal, like the whole dressing room, is to now work so that all Real Madrid fans continue to be excited by their team."" Ronaldo has also scored nine times in his last four games for Madrid and will look to continue his lethal partnership with Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema in attack. However, Real suffered a serious injury blow during the international break as Sami Khedira suffered cruciate ligament damage that is likely to keep him out for the rest of the season. Brazilian midfielder Casemiro is expected to make his first start of the campaign in the German's absence. Coach Carlo Ancelotti also has a problem at left-back as both Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao are sidelined for the next few weeks through injury. Second-placed Atletico Madrid are also in action on Saturday as they host Getafe at the Vicente Calderon. Atleti's top-scorer Diego Costa is not expected to be fit, though, as he is still struggling with the thigh injury that prevented him from making his Spain debut in the world champions' friendly encounters with Equatorial Guinea and South Africa in the past week.

The Argentine was also substituted with a hamstring problem against Atletico Madrid in August and pulled up with a thigh problem in Barca's win over Almeria at the end of September. Messi has failed to score in La Liga since returning from that injury, marking his longest run without a league goal in over two years. However, he had appeared to have returned to form when he scored twice in Barca's 3-1 win over AC Milan in midweek."

65,27/10/2013,23:26,Football: Villa double helps Atletico close in on Barca,David Villa ended his seven-game scoring drought with a double as Atletico Madrid closed to within a point of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 5-0 win over Real Betis.,"Eighteen-year-old sensation Oliver Torres got the hosts off the perfect start on his full league debut with the fastest goal this season after just 13 seconds. Villa then made the game safe with a quickfire brace just after half-time. La Liga's top-scorer Diego Costa took his tally to 13 goals in 13 games in all competitions when he slotted home from Villa's pass 25 minutes from time before Gabi rounded off the scoring in stoppage time. Torres had been handed a start in place of the injured Arda Turan and the Spanish Under-21 international was in the right place at the right time as he slotted home at the back post from Koke's cut-back. Atletico boss Diego Simeone was happy with the impact that Torres made not only with his goal, but his overall display. ""I could see that the team needed the characteristics that Oliver has. ""He was ready to play and he responded brilliantly today. I expect a lot of him, but he is young and still learning."" Costa ought to have scored twice before half-time as he firstly slotted wide when clean through on goal and was then denied by Betis keeper Guillermo Sara who stood up well to turn his effort behind for a corner. Sara had to be replaced by Stephan Andersen at half-time due to an injury, but the Dane's first job was to pick the ball out of the net as Villa neatly flicked home Costa's cross at the near post eight minutes after the restart. And three minutes later Villa smashed home his fifth goal of the season after Koke's pass towards Torres deflected fortunately into his path. ""In the second-half we found Villa in the areas where he lives, in the box,"" Simeone added. ""It is normal for a player of his standing to need to score. We need the best version of Villa and today we saw a glimpse of that."" Costa finally got the goal he craved when Villa's lovely through ball allowed him to plant a left-footed finish into the far corner. He was then withdrawn with one eye on the upcoming league matches against Granada and Athletic Bilbao in mind, but Atletico still had one more goal in them when Gabi fired low into the corner with the last kick of the game. Villarreal strengthened their hold on fourth spot with a 4-1 thrashing of Valencia at the Madrigal. Early goals from Ikechukwu Uche and Hernan Perez put the hosts 2-0 up at half-time before a Giovanni Dos Santos double completed the rout after the break. Real Sociedad continued their recovery with a 3-0 win over the still winless Almeria to move up to ninth. Sevilla also moved into the top half of the table with a 2-1 win over 10-man Osasuna."

72,25/08/2013,00:20,"Football: Barca without injured Messi, Real wait on Bale",World Player of the Year Lionel Messi will miss Barcelona's trip to Malaga on Sunday as he continues to recover from a thigh injury as Real Madrid remained poised to welcome Gareth Bale.,"Messi was substituted at half-time in Barca's 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday and Barca boss Gerardo Martino confirmed the 25-year-old had not been included in his squad as a precaution. ""He is developing well,"" Martino told a press conference on Saturday. ""It is just a precaution. We are optimistic, but it is just three days since the injury occurred and it would be risky to play him, especially so early in the season."" Messi's absence should mean a start for Cesc Fabregas in the false nine role he often occupies for Spain. However, Martino was tight-lipped on whether or not Neymar would be handed his first start for the club after coming off the bench to net his first Barca goal on Wednesday. ""Just because Messi isn't there doesn't mean Neymar has to take the reigns,"" said the coach. ""Neymar is improving all the time, but we need to take things bit by bit to ensure everything goes well in the end. My intention is that when he plays he is able to show all that he can do."" Real Madrid meanwhile aren't in action until Monday night when they travel to face Granada. However, it is looking increasingly unlikely that they will travel to Andalusia with Bale amongst their ranks as there was still no confirmation of his move from Spurs on Saturday. Spanish media reported that the 24-year-old had already arrived in Spain and is waiting in Marbella for the world record deal to be completed before flying to Madrid to be presented to the fans and the media in the coming days. Real will be without Xabi Alonso for up to three months after he broke a bone in his foot earlier this week and minor injuries to Sami Khedira and Asier Illarramendi mean manager Carlo Ancelotti's midfield options are limited. Meanwhile the Italian also has to decide whether to stick with Diego Lopez in goal or recall club captain Iker Casillas after he was surprisingly benched for Real's 2-1 win over Real Betis last weekend. In the night's action on the field, Real Sociedad failed to make it three wins in a week as they were held 1-1 by promoted Elche. The Basques took a huge step towards qualifying for the Champions League group stages for the first time in a decade in midweek as they won 2-0 away to Lyon. However, they were on the back foot straight away in Alicante as Ferran Coro scored the hosts first goal in the top-flight for 24 years. Sociedad improved mightily after the break though and were deservedly level 16 minutes from time when Carlos Vela turned home Xabi Prieto's cross. Espanyol moved alongside Sociedad on four points after two games as they came from behind to beat Valencia 3-1. Helder Postiga scored his first goal for Valencia against the run of play after just 10 minutes. However, David Lopez's equaliser ensured Javi Aguirre's men went in level at half-time and second-half goals from Cristian Stuani and Thievy Bifouma rounded off a fine victory for the Catalans."
73,16/08/2013,02:10,Football: Martino bringing back Barca intensity - Xavi,"Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez believes his side will rekindle their intensity and pressing under the tutelage of new manager Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino.","The Argentine was appointed less than four weeks before Barca kick off the defence of their league title against Levante on Sunday, after Tito Vilanova had to resign due to on-going health problems. However, Xavi believes the squad are adjusting well to Martino's methods and has backed the new coach to be a success despite his lack of managerial experience in Europe. ""He is a leader, capable, prepared and has experience,"" the 33-year-old told Barcelona sports daily Sport. ""He is transmitting a lot to us. We are recovering a little of the intensity and rhythm that perhaps we lost for various reasons towards the end of last season. We are pressing very well and working well physically. ""He is adding things that he is influencing a lot. For example, on set-pieces we are working differently. We are adjusting and he is a guy that is very clear about what he wants."" Martino's insistence on pressing high up the field was very evident in his only game at the Camp Nou so far as Barca destroyed Santos 8-0 in a friendly that formed part of the deal to bring Neymar to the Spanish champions. The Brazilian international will also make his competitive Barcelona debut against Levante, but World Player of the Year Lionel Messi is a doubt as he continues to recover from the quadriceps injury that forced him to miss Argentina's friendly with Italy on Wednesday. Captain Carles Puyol will definitely be absent for the Catalans after he underwent knee surgery to remove a cyst last month, but Cesc Fabregas and Pedro Rodriguez should be fit to play despite missing Spain's friendly with Ecuador in midweek due to minor injuries. Real Madrid also get their league campaign underway on Sunday with a new man in charge as Carlo Ancelotti makes his bow at the Santiago Bernabeu where Real Betis are the visitors. Los Blancos have enjoyed a superb pre-season that encompassed victories over Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Inter Milan and Ancelotti will have a wealth of midfield options to choose from following the capture of Isco and Asier Illarramendi from Malaga and Real Sociedad respectively. Arguably the most enticing fixture of the opening weekend though comes at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan where a new-look Sevilla side host Atletico Madrid. Atletico enjoyed a fantastic campaign last season as they finished third and won the Copa del Rey. As a result they will face Barcelona in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup next week and have Champions League football to look forward to. However, coach Diego Simeone has insisted it is important that his team maintain the consistency they showed in the league last season, starting on Sunday. ""We need to continue in the same way, looking for the consistency we had last season. Therefore, we can't look beyond the present and that is Sevilla,"" he told the club's website. ""We need to start again at zero and not get away from going game by game. We have had a good pre-season, especially physically, and we have been competitive."" New signings David Villa and Leo Baptistao are likely to be involved for Atleti as they try to compensate for the loss of Radamel Falcao, who joined Monaco back in June. However, the transfer activity at Atleti hasn't compared to that at Sevilla and coach Unai Emery could hand debuts to as many as 10 new recruits as the Andalusians have rebuilt following the departures of Jesus Navas, Alvaro Negredo and Gary Medel."
74,12/08/2013,02:32,Football: La Liga transfers - six to watch,Six key signings to look out for as the new La Liga season gets underway on Saturday:,"NEYMAR (Barcelona) By a distance the most discussed transfer in Spanish football this close season was Neymar's 57 million euro ($74m, £48.7m) move from Santos to Barcelona. The 21-year-old had long been linked with a move to the Spanish champions, but Barca's 7-0 two-leg humiliation at the hands of Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League semi-final accelerated the Catalans push for an extra option in attack. How Neymar combines with World Player of the Year Lionel Messi remains to be seen, but as he showed in a starring role at the Confederations Cup in June, the Brazilian international has the pace, skill and finishing ability to give Barca the reliable scoring outlet apart from Messi that they have lacked in recent seasons. ISCO (Real Madrid) Somewhat scorned by Barcelona's dominance of the Spanish national team in recent times, Real Madrid have invested heavily in two of the squad that helped Spain retain their Under-21 European Championship title in June. Isco was the first to arrive for a reported fee of 30 million euros after leading Malaga to the quarter-finals of the Champions League last season on their first participation in the competition. However, whilst the 22-year-old has shone brightly in pre-season, he may find first-team opportunities in his preferred play-making role behind a main striker limited at the Bernabeu due to the presence of German international Mesut Ozil. ASIER ILLARRAMENDI (Real Madrid) Having secured Isco, Madrid then spent 38.9 million euros to activate Illarramendi's release clause from Real Sociedad in a move intended to see the 23-year-old eventually succeed the ageing Xabi Alonso. Like Alonso, Illarramendi has a fine range of passing and is most effective playing just in front of the back four. And whilst the incredible wealth of midfield options available to new Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti may make it difficult for Illarramendi to claim a place in the side straight away, he will see plenty of minutes as Alonso is rested for the more straightforward league games later in the season. DAVID VILLA (Atletico Madrid) As soon as Neymar's move to Barcelona was confirmed it seemed inevitable that Villa would be on his way out of the Camp Nou and Atletico have arguably done the best business of the transfer window by snapping up Spain's all-time record goalscorer for an initial fee of just 2.1 million euros. Diego Simeone's side were in the market for a striker having sold Radamel Falcao to big-spending Monaco and it is hoped that a regular place in the side and playing as a central striker as opposed to the wide position he occupied at Barcelona will see Villa recover his golden touch in front of goal. Until breaking his tibia midway through the 2011-12 season, the 31-year-old had scored at least 20 league goals for 10 straight seasons and should he repeat that figure, Atletico will be well-compensated for the loss of Falcao who scored 70 goals in his two seasons in the Spanish capital. BENAT ETXEBARRIA (Athletic Bilbao) With so little money being spent by those outside the big two, the most significant transfer between two Spanish clubs not involving Madrid or Barca was Benat's return to Athletic Bilbao from Real Betis for eight million euros. The Basques were still flush with cash from the sale of Javi Martinez to Bayern Munich for 40 million euros last year and struggled mightily last season having failed to replace the Spanish international. Whilst Benat offers a lot more flair and less power than Martinez, he should make an excellent signing for Athletic with the service he provides allowing Ander Herrera, Oscar de Marcos and Iker Muniain to recover the form they showed in the 2011/12 season when Athletic reached both the Copa del Rey and Europa League finals. Benat's excellent delivery from set-piece situations will also be a handy asset as with the likes of Mikel San Jose, Kike Sola and Aritz Aduriz in their ranks, Ernesto Valderde's men will be extremely dangerous from corners and free-kicks. KEVIN GAMEIRO (Sevilla) The biggest transfer fee paid by a club outside the big two was Sevilla's capture of Gameiro from Paris Saint-Germain for a reported 10 million euros. A former French international, Gameiro had seen his playing time with the French champions severely limited by the signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic last season but could be given a new lease of life in a very new-look Sevilla side. Spanish internationals Alvaro Negredo and Jesus Navas have both gone to Manchester City, but Gameiro should still be able to rely on decent service from Ivan Rakitic and Piotr Trochowski as he returns from nearly a year out through injury."
75,12/08/2013,02:30,"Football: Gap widens as Barca, Real spend and rest sell","Looking at the Spanish sports pages over the typically baking summer months, it would appear the Spanish game was in rude health both on and off the pitch.","In Catalonia, Neymar has dominated attention after his 57 million euro ($74 million, £48.7 million) move from Santos to Barcelona was confirmed in June, whilst, in the capital, Real Madrid backed up their 69 million euro investment in the young Spanish duo of Isco and Asier Illarramendi with an on-going pursuit of the 100 million euro rated Gareth Bale in a saga that looks set to run well into the final days of the transfer window. But beneath the big two, the game in Spain has continued to reflect the general ailing Spanish economy with even clubs in the Champions League forced to sell their best players. As a result, the already colossal gap between Real and Barca and the rest continues to increase as do fears that by continuing to use an unbalanced TV deal that greatly favours the big two, La Liga descends further into a turgid two-horse race. However, whilst both Barca and Real have been active in the transfer market, there are concerns that both have so far failed to bring in the type of players they really needed after falling at the semi-final stage of the Champions League last season. Neymar's arrival should certainly ease the scoring burden that Lionel Messi has carried almost single-handedly for the past two seasons, but the Catalans still look very threadbare at the back with captain Carles Puyol having undergone two operations during the close season and not due back till at least September. Real meanwhile have bolstered an already strong midfield, but haven't so far replaced Gonzalo Higuain after he joined Napoli last month leaving only Karim Benzema and youngster Alvaro Morata to fill the lone striker's position. There is though already a great deal more calm around Los Blancos following the departure of Jose Mourinho with the management team of Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane highly-respected by the squad and the players themselves coming together as a unit following the public clashes and fallouts that marked the Portuguese's final season at the Bernabeu. That greater unity should mean Real push Barca a great deal closer than they did last season, but the title will again be defined by small margins. Such is their dominance that firstly Real and then Barca amassed 100 points in winning the title in the past two seasons and with the gap only set to widen between them and the rest, it is highly likely whoever becomes champions will need to register a century of points once more. In the battle for Champions League places, Atletico Madrid seem the best set despite losing star man Radamel Falcao to Monaco. Atletico have arguably done the best business in terms of value for money as they replaced the 60 million euro Colombian with David Villa for an inital fee of just 2.1 million euros. Continuing an uncharacteristic period of stability since Diego Simeone took charge of the club in December 2011, Atletico are only the only club to finish in the top six last season that haven't changed manager over the close season and they are heavy favourites to be the best of the rest once more. Further down, Valencia, Sevilla, Real Betis and Real Sociedad are all likely to be in the mix for the European places despite all losing key players in recent months. Valencia have replaced new Spurs signing Roberto Soldado with a former Spurs player, Helder Postiga, for a tenth of the price they sold Soldado, whilst Sevilla have also seen two Spanish internationals depart as Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo have joined Manchester City. However, they will still most likely battle it out for the final Champions League place as last season's surprise package Sociedad haven't invested heavily in their squad despite the 39 million euro windfall they received from Illarramendi's departure. Betis have lost their key creative lynchpin in Benat Extebarria after he rejoined Athletic Bilbao and the Basques themselves will be hoping for a far more successful campaign than their 12th-placed finish last season following the appointment of the highly-rated Ernesto Valverde as manager."
