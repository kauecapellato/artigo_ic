0,13/02/2021,17:38,Haaland spares Dortmund blushes,A late equaliser from Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes on Saturday as they drew 2-2 at home against Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim.,"Haaland's 81st minute strike averted a fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games for crisis-hit Dortmund. Yet even a draw leaves Dortmund three points adrift of the Champions League places in sixth, and heaps more pressure on interim coach Edin Terzic. Dortmund have won just four of ten league games since Terzic took the reins from Lucien Favre in December, prompting growing speculation over his future. Yet veteran defender Mats Hummels defended his coach on Saturday and backed Dortmund to revive their season. ""It's never the case that things are exactly how you want them a few weeks after a new coach takes over. That wasn't the case years ago under Jurgen Klopp, and it isn't the case now under Edin,"" Hummels told Sky. ""We're working hard, and success will come,"" he added. England international Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund a perfect start, racing up the left-wing to score his fourth league goal this season on 24 minutes. The lead didn't last long, as Munas Dabbur scuffed a shot past Marwin Hitz to level just seven minutes later. Ihlas Bebou bundled in Hoffenheim's second just after half-time, the ball bouncing off the Togolese and into the goal as Hitz tried to beat away a dangerous cross from the left wing. Haaland had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before pouncing on a misplaced pass to snatch a crucial late equaliser. Fellow Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points after they conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with strugglers Mainz. Lucas Alario tapped in a low Moussa Diaby cross to give Leverkusen the lead on 14 minutes. Patrik Schick appeared to have sealed three points with a second on 84 minutes. Yet second-from-bottom Mainz were rewarded for a brave performance as late goals by Robert Glatzel and Kevin Stoeger saved a point and continued their recent revival under new coach Bo Svensson. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Freiburg while Sami Khedira helped rescue a 1-1 draw for Hertha Berlin against boyhood club Stuttgart. ""It was the first time I'd ever played against Stuttgart so it was strange, but it was nice to come back,"" Khedira, who joined Hertha from Juventus in January after a decade abroad, told Sky. Austrian striker Sasa Kalajdzic headed in his ninth goal of the season to give Stuttgart the lead at the end of a scrappy first half. Veteran midfielder Khedira came off the bench in the second-half and set up a late equaliser for 17-year-old Luca Netz to save the capital club from a fifth straight defeat."
1,29/01/2021,23:18,Wamangituka's stunning solo effort seals Stuttgart win,Congolese winger Silas Wamangituka scored for his fourth consecutive Bundesliga game on Friday as his end-to-end goal after an 80-metre sprint sealed Stuttgart's 2-0 win at home to strugglers Mainz.,"After striker Sasa Kalajdzic gave Stuttgart the lead ten minutes into the second-half, Wamangituka showed his stamina and skill to score with a run from the edge of his own box. With Mainz hunting the equaliser, a charged down shot fell to Wamangituka, who dribbled the length of the pitch before, beating two defenders to fire home 18 minutes from the whistle. The 21-year-old's stunning effort means he has scored 11 times in Germany's top flight this season. The win leaves Stuttgart 10th. Mainz remain second-from-bottom and seven points from escaping the relegation places after failing to build on last weekend's shock 3-2 win over second-placed RB Leipzig. League leaders Bayern Munich hold a seven-point lead before Saturday's home game against mid-table Hoffenheim."
2,10/01/2021,19:25,Matarazzo at a loss to explain Stuttgart's latest away win,Stuttgart coach Pellegrino Matarazzo said he was unable to explain his side's impressive away form after Sunday's 4-1 win at Augsburg made them the Bundesliga's joint-strongest team on the road.,"Alongside Bayer Leverkusen, who have also won five times and lost once away this season, Matarazzo's men have a better record than Bayern Munich, who remain top despite losing 3-2 at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday. ""The only difference is that we stay in a hotel,"" the 43-year-old Italian-American said. ""Perhaps we should consider an overnight stay before our home games too,"" he quipped. ""The win does us good, to get back on the right path after two games without a point,"" he added as his outfit picked up their first win since last month's away thrashing of Borussia Dortmund. Raised in New York to Italian parents, Matarazzo earned a maths degree at Colombia University before moving to Europe, eventually becoming Julian Nagelsmann's assistant coach at Hoffenheim before taking charge of Stuttgart in 2019. The visitors took the lead on Sunday through Argentine striker Nicolas Gonzalez's early penalty after Augsburg's West Ham loanee Reece Oxford fouled Mateo Klimowicz in the area. The visitors were 2-0 up at half-time after Congolese winger Silas Wamangituka finished a counter-attack with his first goal since netting twice in the 5-1 win at Dortmund. Augsburg pulled a goal back almost immediately after the break when midfielder Marco Richter fired home from close range after Swiss winger Ruben Vargas prised open the defence. Stuttgart captain Gonzalez Castro fired his side 3-1 up on the hour mark when he banged home a long pass to the far post. Soon after, Richter received his second booking inside three minutes and was shown a red card after accidentally kicking the Achilles tendon of Waldemar Anton. The Stuttgart defender had the last laugh when his cross to the far post was tapped home by substitute Daniel Didavi three minutes before the whistle. After two defeats and a draw in their previous three league games, the victory lifts Stuttgart above Augsburg into 10th."
3,10/01/2021,17:55,Stuttgart romp to first league win since thrashing Dortmund,Stuttgart romped to a 4-1 triumph at 10-man Augsburg on Sunday to earn their first Bundesliga win since thrashing Borussia Dortmund last month.,"Stuttgart claimed their fifth away win this season after taking the lead at Augsburg thanks to Argentine striker Nicolas Gonzalez's early penalty which came when his south American compatriot Mateo Klimowicz was fouled in the area. Stuttgart were 2-0 up at half-time after Congolese winger Silas Wamangituka finished a counter-attack with his first goal since netting twice in the 5-1 win at Dortmund which ultimately cost Lucien Favre his job. Augsburg pulled a goal back almost immediately after the break when midfielder Marco Richter fired home from close range after Swiss winger Ruben Vargas prised open the defence. Stuttgart captain Gonzalez Castro fired his side 3-1 up on the hour mark when he banged home a long pass to the far post. Soon after, Richter received his second booking inside three minutes and was shown a red card after accidentally kicking the Achilles tendon of Waldemar Anton. The Stuttgart defender had the last laugh when his cross to the far post was tapped home by substitute Daniel Didavi three minutes before the whistle. After two defeats and a draw in their previous three league games, the victory lifts Stuttgart above Augsburg into 10th. Bayern Munich remain top of the Bundesliga despite crashing to a 3-2 loss at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday while second-placed RB Leipzig lost 3-1 at home on Saturday to Dortmund, the only top six team to win this weekend."
4,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
5,12/12/2020,18:36,'Disaster' as Dortmund suffer worst home defeat in more than decade,"Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre admitted his side suffered a ""disaster"" in the Bundesliga title race on Saturday after being routed 5-1 by VfB Stuttgart to suffer their heaviest home defeat in over a decade.","Stuttgart's Congo winger Silas Wamangituka netted twice in the romp which piled the pressure on Favre with fifth-placed Dortmund now five points behind leaders RB Leipzig. ""Things went mercilessly wrong,"" admitted Dortmund defender Mats Hummels. ""We shot ourselves in the foot every few minutes."" Dortmund have taken just a point in their two league games since star striker Erling Braut Haaland was ruled out until January with a hip injury. Stuttgart's relentless pressing and sloppy Dortmund defending resulted in the visitors scoring four unanswered second-half goals. ""We are not a team that can defend well, that has to be said quite clearly,"" fumed Dortmund captain Marco Reus, while Favre admitted it was ""a disaster"". Wamangituka converted a penalty midway through the first half after Dortmund's Emre Can brought down Mateo Klimowicz. Dortmund equalised just before the break when a superb Raphael Guerreiro long ball picked out Giovanni Reyna, who deftly chipped home. It was 1-1 at the break, but the floodgates opened in the second period as nearly every Dortmund mistake was punished with a Stuttgart goal. Guerreiro lost control of the ball on the edge of his penalty area and Wamangituka claimed his second goal eight minutes after the break. Midfielder Philip Foerster, in for suspended Stuttgart captain Gonzalo Castro, scored with a perfectly timed run into the area with an hour played. Jude Belligham's stray pass was then snapped up by Wamangituka and moved to striker Tanguy Coulibaly, who fired home on 63 minutes. The VAR ruled out a second Reyna goal late on before a mistake by Dortmund's Nico Schulz saw Nicolas Gonzalez claim Stuttgart's fifth goal. The debacle is Dortmund's heaviest home defeat since being humbled 5-1 at home to Bayern Munich in 2009. Fresh from knocking Manchester United out of the Champions League in midweek, RB Leipzig saw off Werder Bremen 2-0 to leapfrog Bayern into top spot in the table. Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty and Dani Olmo, who shone in the attacking midfield role, grabbed a first-half goal for the hosts. The victory left Leipzig a point clear of defending champions Bayern, who can regain first place at FC Union later in Berlin. The home win capped a good week for Leipzig, who knocked United out of Europe on Tuesday with a 3-2 victory to reach the last 16 of the Champions League. Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi scored his first goal for Hertha Berlin in their 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Guendouzi scored just after the break when Gladbach's Denis Zakaria lost possession on the edge of his area. Gladbach, who also reached the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, fought their way back and equalised through Breel Embolo on 70 minutes. Freiburg ended their nine-match winless run with a 2-0 win over Arminia Bielefeld. Nils Petersen hit the woodwork twice before Vincenzo Grifo converted a late penalty. Then South Korean midfielder Jeong Woo-yeong, on loan from Bayern Munich, scored in added time. Cologne stay just above the relegation places after their 1-0 win at second-from-bottom Mainz."
6,12/12/2020,17:38,Leipzig top Bundesliga as Dortmund crash to heavy home defeat,"Fresh from knocking Manchester United out of the Champions League in midweek, RB Leipzig saw off Werder Bremen 2-0 on Saturday to leapfrog Bayern Munich into top spot in the Bundesliga table.","Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty and Dani Olmo, who shone in the attacking midfield role, grabbed a first-half goal for the hosts. The victory left Leipzig a point clear of defending champions Bayern, who can regain first place at FC Union later on Saturday in Berlin. The home win capped a good week for Leipzig, who knocked United out of Europe on Tuesday with a 3-2 victory to reach the last 16 of the Champions League. Borussia Dortmund, also through to the knock-out stages in Europe, lost ground in the title race, dropping to fifth, after crashing 5-1 at home to Stuttgart, whose winger Silas Wamangituka netted twice."
7,06/12/2020,17:59,'Disrespectful' Wamangituka fires Stuttgart past Bremen,"Congolese striker Silas Wamangituka scored twice to give Stuttgart a 2-1 away win over Werder Bremen on Sunday, in a cagey encounter between two of the Bundesliga's struggling giants.","After scoring from the spot in the first half, Wamangituka prompted a furious reaction from the Bremen players when he provocatively walked the ball into the open goal to seal the win in stoppage time. ""The way he finished was obviously disrespectful. He had a very good game and he should just tap the ball in, and not make a song and dance about it,"" Bremen's Davie Selke told Sky. It was a first win in six games for promoted side Stuttgart, who have nonetheless started strongly upon their return to the Bundesliga under American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo. Matarazzo's side now sit eighth in the table, having picked up 14 points from their first 10 games. Wamangituka gave Stuttgart the lead just after the half-hour mark, smashing the ball in from 12 yards after Manchester United loanee Tahith Chong fouled Wataru Endo in the box. The visitors held Bremen at bay for much of the second half, and had several chances to double their lead on the counter-attack. Wamangituka finally sealed the victory in stoppage time after pouncing on a mistake by goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Yet he was booked for unsportsmanlike conduct after taking his time to put the ball in the open net. Selke nodded in a consolation goal before the final whistle, but it was too little, too late for the home side. Bremen have not won since the first week of October, and have now dropped to 12th after a promising start to the season. Having avoided relegation by the skin of their teeth last season, the four-time Bundesliga winners are hoping to avoid being dragged into another fight for survival this season."
8,28/11/2020,17:41,Lewandowski hits 15th goal of season as Bayern Munich stay top,Robert Lewandowski claimed his 15th goal this season in all competitions as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich came from behind to claim a 3-1 win at Stuttgart on Saturday.,"After 19-year-old striker Tanguy Coulibaly gave Stuttgart a shock early lead, Kingsley Coman equalised before Lewandowski drilled home from 20 metres to put Bayern 2-1 up at the break. Brazil winger Douglas Costa, a second-half replacement for Coman, grabbed Bayern's third goal late on to seal the win which leaves the holders two points clear of RB Leipzig. Dortmund are third, four points behind Bayern, after crashing to a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne, as Leipzig climbed above them thanks to a 2-1 home win over Arminia Bielefeld. Cologne avoided a club record 19th match without a win with their first victory in Dortmund since 1991."
9,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
10,07/11/2020,18:33,"Leipzig go top in Germany ahead of Bayern, Dortmund showdown",RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown.,"Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. He was especially pleased with Konate's opening goal from a towering cross before winger Christopher Nkunku, who scored in the mid-week win over Paris Saint Germain, won the penalty which Sabitzer converted after the VAR scrutinised the decision. ""We have trained a lot from set pieces,"" said Nagelsmann. ""It certainly wasn't an obvious penalty, but if the VAR says it was, then it must have been,"" he added after Nkunku went down after the slightest of touches from Freiburg defender Nicolas Hoefler. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. After just three minutes, Japan winger Keita Endo scored his first goal for Union when he swept home Sheraldo Becker's final pass after Kruse's superb long pass. Endo went off with an injury soon after, but Union kept up the pressure as Kruse set up the next two goals for centre-back Robert Andrich and winger Becker. Kruse, 32, capped an outstanding display by converting a penalty before Cedric Teuchert, a right wing replacement for Becker, grabbed Union's late fourth goal. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After Daniel Brosinski and Jean-Philippe Mateta converted penalties for Mainz, Mark Uth pulled a goal back for Schalke who were 2-1 down late on. Schalke took a deserved point back to Gelsenkirchen when Mainz defender Jeremiah St. Juste turned the ball into his own net eight minutes from time. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 win in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet as Augsburg's defence crumbled."
11,03/10/2020,17:58,Haaland nets twice as Dortmund run riot,Erling Braut Haaland again demonstrated his deadly finishing by netting twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the Bundesliga table with a 4-0 demolition of Freiburg.,"Dortmund bounced back from last weekend's shock defeat at Augsburg as Haaland shone to leave him on 21 goals in 23 games for Dortmund since his January transfer as the burly Norwegian claimed clinically-taken goals. Having also scored in Wednesday's German Super Cup 3-2 defeat at Bayern Munich, the 20-year-old Haaland has netted five goals in as many games this season. Dortmund were missing England winger Jadon Sancho and goalkeeper Roman Buerki, both recovering from illness having tested negative for the coronavirus. Club captain Marco Reus made his first start for eight months after a groin injury. US teenager Giovanni Reyna, who assisted all three goals, was outstanding alongside Reus in the attacking midfield role for Dortmund. The 17-year-old played Haaland into space for the burly Norwegian to score both his goals, then delivered a pin-point corner for Emre Can's headed goal. Haaland, 19, once again showed dazzling finishing when he fired home from a right angle on 31 minutes. Can then rose highest from a corner and his bullet header put Dortmund 2-0 up two minutes after the break. Reyna and Haaland combined again when they got in behind the defence as the American delayed his pass which the Norwegian hammered into the net on 66 minutes. Winger Felix Passlack claimed his first Bundesliga goal in added time to complete the rout with Haaland providing the final pass. Defending champions Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin on Sunday out to bounce back from last weekend's shock defeat at Hoffenheim to end their 23-match winning streak. Eintracht Frankfurt top the league table after their 2-1 win over previous leaders Hoffeheim. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric netted his eighth goal in four games with a superb strike, curled inside the far corner, to give Hoffenheim the lead on 18 minutes. However, Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada turned the game when he tapped home on 54 minutes, then powered through the defence before Bas Dost stabbed the ball over the line on 19 minutes from time. It could have been 3-1 as Frankfurt had a late goal disallowed. Champions League side Moenchenegladbach romped to a 3-1 win at Cologne as Alassane Plea and Stefan Lainer fired home before Lars Stindl added a penalty on 56 minutes. Cologne scored a consolation goal when Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer from 20 metres out. Bremen earned a second win in three games when Leonardo Bittencourt's right-footed shot on 27 minutes sealed their 1-0 win at home to new boys Arminia Bielefeld. The hosts survived a late scare as Bielefeld had a goal disallowed just before the whistle. Leverkusen were held to a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart as Patrik Schick's early goal was cancelled out by an equaliser by the hosts' striker Sasa Kalajdzic. On Friday, Union Berlin enjoyed their first win of the season with a 4-0 thumping of Mainz at home as Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first goal for the hosts."
12,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
13,10/09/2020,15:34,Trickle of fans return as German Cup kicks off new season,Limited numbers of football fans will watch matches in stadiums across Germany for the first time in six months this weekend when the first round of the German Cup kicks off.,"There is an odd number of 31 matches spread over the weekend as holders Bayern Munich will only play fifth-tier side FC Dueren in mid-October. The Champions League winners have been granted extra rest following their victory over Paris Saint-Germain in Lisbon on August 23. There are no all-Bundesliga matches, giving smaller clubs the chance to claim a big-name scalp. Potential giant-killers are third division side Duisburg who host Ruhr neighbours Borussia Dortmund and fourth-tier team Schweinfurt, who are up against Schalke 04. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the German FA has permitted each host club to admit a set number of home fans -- travelling supporters are banned -- providing the local health authority gives permission. ""38,677 spectators are allowed to watch the German Cup this weekend - unfortunately spread over 31 matches,"" German daily Bild pointed out. The result is huge regional differences in numbers of spectators allowed with some games to be played behind closed doors. In eastern Germany, where the rate of infection remains low, 10,000 fans are expected to watch Dynamo Dresden play Hamburg on Monday. Likewise, a crowd of 7,500 can see Hansa Rostock against VfB Stuttgart on Sunday. However, in southern Germany, which has been more affected by the pandemic, second division Nuremberg host Champions League semi-finalists RB Leipzig behind closed doors. The same applies to 1860 Munich's home tie against Eintracht Frankfurt and seven other first-round games. In fact, 11 lower leagues sides have waived home advantage against bigger clubs better equipped to meet the strict hygiene measures. One example is fourth-tier side VSG Altglienicke, who opted to play at Bundesliga side Cologne and are relishing the trip. ""It's quite exciting,"" Altglienicke coach Karsten Heine told newspaper the Berliner Morgenpost, with his squad looking forward to playing at Cologne's stadium ""for perhaps the first and last time"". Likewise, Bremen-based FC Oberneuland are renting a double-decker bus having opted to play their tie at Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach. The fifth-tier team are arriving a day early so they can have a tour of Borussia Park, where only 300 fans will be allowed in for Saturday's fixture."
14,16/07/2020,15:45,Stuttgart join cash-strapped Bundesliga clubs seeking state aid,Newly-promoted VfB Stuttgart are the latest cash-strapped Bundesliga club seeking financial aid because of lost matchday revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic.,"Stuttgart finished runners-up in Germany's second division at the end of June to win promotion back to the Bundesliga a year after being relegated. However, the 2007 German champions are among established names needing help balancing the books. ""During the lockdown phase, we examined all the possibilities for economic stabilisation and... applied for funding in order to secure our liquidity,"" the club's finance officer Stefan Heim told newspapers the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung. ""This was one of the measures we took to ensure VfB's economic survival at a time when nobody could predict when and how things would continue in football."" Heim said Stuttgart applied for aid through the state-owned KfW Bank, reportedly seeking a loan of around 15 million euros ($17 million). They are not alone. Germany's top clubs are counting the cost of lost revenue as the last nine rounds of matches in the top two tiers were played behind closed doors due to the pandemic. Werder Bremen, who just managed top stay in the Bundesliga after winning the relegation/promotion play-off, have confirmed that they want a loan from the state-owned KfW Bank. Schalke 04, who had debts of 198 million euros before the pandemic, recently applied to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia for a guarantee to secure a loan, reportedly worth around 40 million euros. Gelsenkirchen-based Schalke lost around two million euros of revenue for each of the four home games behind closed doors. Even runners-up Borussia Dortmund are looking into ways of securing financial help from the state, according to magazine Der Spiegel. However, Dortmund's chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke says the government must check whether clubs hit financial difficulties through the coronavirus or bad management. ""The State must check whether these are real effects of corona or not,"" said Watzke. Others agree and the situation is the subject of debate in Germany. ""It should not be the case that failed business models in football are artificially maintained by taxpayers' money,"" Jens Ammann from the German Taxpayers Federation told website Business Insider. ""It can't be that professional salaries in the millions might end up being paid for by tax money."" SID-ryj/pb <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
15,21/06/2020,17:47,Stuttgart move to brink of Bundesliga promotion,Stuttgart moved to the brink of an immediate promotion back to the Bundesliga on Sunday thanks to their 6-0 thrashing of Nuremberg coupled with Hamburg's dramatic late defeat at Heidenheim.,"Five-time German champions Stuttgart went into the penultimate day of the season one point clear of Hamburg and with an inferior goal difference, only to all but secure a return to the top flight with a thumping victory. Hamburg's promotion push was severely dented as they collapsed to defeat at Heidenheim despite leading with 11 minutes to play. Substitute Konstantin Kerschbaumer scored a 95th-minute winner to clinch a 2-1 success which saw Heidenheim leapfrog Hamburg into third in Bundesliga 2, which carries a play-off against the 16th-placed side from the top division -- currently Fortuna Duesseldorf. Stuttgart, in the second automatic promotion slot, lead Heidenheim by three points with a goal difference 11 better, with Hamburg one point further back. Heidenheim visit Arminia Bielefeld, who have already been crowned second-tier champions and promoted, in their final match of the campaign next Sunday, while Stuttgart host Darmstadt and Hamburg take on Sandhausen."
16,23/05/2019,22:41,Friedrich equaliser puts Stuttgart on brink,Union Berlin defender Marvin Friedrich went from zero to hero and kept his side dreaming of promotion to Germany's top flight as they fought to a 2-2 draw at Stuttgart in the first leg of the Bundesliga relegation play-off.,"Friedrich headed home the away side's second equaliser 22 minutes from the end, not long after comically deflecting Mario Gomez's weak shot past his own goalkeeper, to give the Berliners the edge with two away goals going into the second leg. The draw means three-time German champions Stuttgart must beat second-tier side Union in the capital on Monday to avoid relegation, after finishing third from bottom in the top division. Anastasios Donis ran almost the full length of the pitch to set up Christian Gentner for Stuttgart's opener just before half-time, but Union hit back through Suleiman Abdullahi directly from the restart. Abdullahi, who missed a late chance to secure automatic promotion in Bochum at the weekend, picked up a long ball flicked on by Sebastian Andersson and smashed the ball in from just inside the area. Stuttgart coach Nico Willig brought on Gomez at half-time, and the veteran striker restored the home side's lead five minutes later when he scuffed his shot in off the head of the unfortunate Friedrich. Friedrich's redemption came 15 minutes later as he headed the visitors level again, giving them the advantage ahead of the decisive return leg at the Alte Foersterei stadium."
17,20/05/2019,12:51,Stuttgart announce Tim Walter as new coach,Relegation-threatened Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart announced Monday that current Holstein Kiel boss Tim Walter will take over as head coach at the end of the season.,"Walter, 43, led Kiel to sixth in the second division this season and has now signed a two-year deal to become the long-term successor to former Stuttgart boss Markus Weinzierl, who was sacked in April. ""Tim Walter's idea of brave, attacking football fits Stuttgart brilliantly,"" said Stuttgart sporting director Thomas Hitzlsperger. ""Together, we want to place more focus on our own youth players."" Walter, who worked as a youth coach at Bayern Munich and Karlsruhe before taking over at Kiel last year, will take over after Stuttgart's fate is decided in the relegation play-off next week. Interim coach Nico Willig will remain in charge for the play-off games on Thursday and Monday, as Stuttgart look to avoid the drop against promotion hopefuls Union Berlin."
18,11/05/2019,18:02,Dortmund take title race to wire as Bayern held,Bayern Munich missed the chance to wrap up a seventh successive Bundesliga title as they were held to a goalless draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday and rivals Borussia Dortmund edged a nervy 3-2 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf.,"Chelsea-bound US international Christian Pulisic found the net in his final home game for Dortmund, helping them to battle back to within two points of league leaders Bayern ahead of the final round of games next weekend. Bayern can now secure the title with a win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt next Saturday, while Dortmund must win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Dortmund, who looked dead and buried after slipping four points behind last week, enjoyed the rub of the green as they stumbled to victory over Duesseldorf. Pulisic, who will join Chelsea next season, bid an emotional farewell to the Dortmund fans before the game and then opened the scoring on 41 minutes. A howler from stand-in goalkeeper Marwin Hitz allowed Oliver Fink to equalise, but Thomas Delaney restored the lead for Dortmund. Hitz then gave away a penalty with a foul on Dodi Lukebakio, but the Belgian dragged the ball wide from 12 yards. Mario Goetze appeared to seal the win for Dortmund on 90 minutes, but Dawid Kownacki pulled one back for Duesseldorf minutes later to make it a nerve-jangling finish for the hosts. In Leipzig, Leon Goretzka's stylish scissor-kick sent Bayern into ecstasy after half-time, but the goal was ruled out by VAR. Serge Gnabry hit the bar later in the second half, but Bayern could not force the winner. At the other end of the table, Nuremberg and Hanover were finally relegated as Stuttgart secured the relegation play-off place with a 3-0 win over Wolfsburg. Hanover went down fighting as goals from Waldemar Anton, Ihlas Bebou and Walace saw them beat Freiburg 3-0. Yet Anastasios Donis, Gonzalo Castro and Daniel Didavi were on the mark for Stuttgart to condemn Hanover and Nuremberg to the drop. Nuremberg, meanwhile, suffered a 4-0 defeat to Borussia Moenchengladbach thanks to an own-goal from Lukas Muehl and strikes from Thorgan Hazard, Denis Zakaria and former Nuremberg man Josip Drmic. The thumping win sees Gladbach go fourth overnight, leapfrogging both Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen, who were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke, Guido Burgstaller cancelling out Kai Havertz's opener. Frankfurt have the chance to break back into the top four with a win over Mainz on Sunday. Werder Bremen also kept their European hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim, and Hertha Berlin snatched a late 4-3 victory away to Augsburg. Johannes Eggestein's first-half goal condemned RB Leipzig-bound coach Julian Nagelsmann to defeat in his last home game in charge of Hoffenheim. Andre Hahn and Michael Gregoritsch put Augsburg ahead three times but goals from Marvin Plattenhardt and Marko Grujic kept Hertha in the game before a late brace from Salomon Kalou secured three points."
19,04/05/2019,21:00,Dortmund collapse leaves Bayern on brink of seventh successive title,Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre defended goalkeeper Roman Buerki after his second-half howler saw Dortmund throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Werder Bremen and left Bayern Munich on the brink of a seventh successive Bundesliga title.,"""I am not going to talk about Roman. Whatever happens, he has had a fantastic season and has saved us a lot of points in the past,"" Favre told Sky. Buerki's error and a goal from Claudio Pizarro all but ended Dortmund's title challenge and sealed a perfect afternoon for Bayern, after club stalwarts Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben earlier returned from injury to help them to a 3-1 victory over bottom club Hanover. Dortmund, who were nine points ahead of Bayern in December, must now make up a four-point deficit in the last two games of the season. ""We have to win our last home game next week, that is our only hope,"" said Favre. Christian Pulisic opened the scoring for Dortmund after just six minutes with a brilliant solo goal, before Paco Alcacer doubled the lead with a fizzing free-kick. With Dortmund in full control on 70 minutes, Buerki allowed Bremen back into the game when he let Kevin Moehwald's tame shot through his legs, and former Bayern star Pizarro scored a shock equaliser moments later. ""If we can help Bayern, why not?"" a smiling Pizarro told Sky. In Munich, Robben and Ribery, both of whom are set to leave Bayern at the end of the season, came off the bench to make their first appearance together in 2019. Ribery scored what may be his last ever goal at the Allianz Arena, while Robben, who had not played since November, told Sky that his cameo appearance was not the end of his Bayern journey. ""I always said I didn't want to come back just to wave to the fans and say goodbye. There are two games left and the German Cup final, so there is more to come,"" he said. Hanover kept Bayern at bay for nearly half an hour before Robert Lewandowski headed the hosts ahead from close range and Leon Goretzka curled the second in off the post. The visitors hit back after half-time with a Jonathas penalty, the result of a highly controversial handball decision from VAR against Jerome Boateng. Ribery secured the win with a deflected shot six minutes from time. Bayern now need just one win from their last two games against top four sides RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Hoffenheim both stumbled in the race for the top four, as they shared the points in a 2-2 draw. Matthias Ginter cancelled out Pavel Kaderabek's opener, before Nadiem Amiri restored the lead with a fine volley. Josip Drmic saved Gladbach's Champions League hopes with a late equaliser. Wolfsburg also remain in the hunt for a top four place after goals from Felix Klaus and Marcel Tisserand saw them beat second-from-bottom Nuremberg 2-0. Both Nuremberg and Hanover were spared relegation for at least another week, however, as Hertha Berlin won 3-1 at home to Stuttgart, who remain in the relegation play-off place. Goals from Vedad Ibisevic, Ondrej Duda and Salomon Kalou sealed the win for Hertha, despite a late consolation header from Mario Gomez."
20,20/04/2019,17:52,Bayern grind out Bremen win to stay ahead of Dortmund,Niklas Suele's late goal saw Bayern Munich break a brave resistance from ten-man Werder Bremen to snatch a crucial 1-0 win and stay ahead of Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga title race.,"Bayern toiled in the searing Bavarian sun against Bremen, eventually grinding out the victory to go four points clear at the top. The win puts pressure on title rivals Dortmund, who need to win a tough away game in Freiburg on Sunday if they are to remain within a point of Bayern. Bremen held Bayern at bay for much of the game, but suffered a lethal blow just before the hour mark, when Milos Veljkovic was sent off for a second yellow card. Chances came and went for Bayern as the clock ticked down, until Suele finally broke through with a deflected shot from the edge of the area 15 minutes from time. ""I had a couple of shots against Dortmund which were a bit NFL-like, so it was nice to score the winning goal today,"" Suele told Sky. Third-placed RB Leipzig, meanwhile, have one foot in next season's Champions League after a 2-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach put them 10 points clear of their fifth-placed opponents. ""We won't let go of our top four place now,"" Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick told Sky. Having scored a penalty in the first half, Marcel Halstenberg added another shortly after half-time to put Leipzig in full control. Alassane Plea pulled one back for Gladbach, but the home side ultimately missed the chance to break into the top four, and remain a point behind Eintracht Frankfurt, who play on Monday. At the other end of the table, Stuttgart look doomed to a bottom-three finish after they suffered a humiliating 6-0 thrashing by fellow strugglers Augsburg. Augsburg obliterated their relegation rivals with a delightful display of attacking football. Goals from Rani Khedira, Andre Hahn and Philipp Max saw them establish a 3-0 lead before the half-hour mark. Max added another in the second half, and a Marco Richter double completed the rout and sealed the fate of Stuttgart coach Markus Weinzierl who was sacked later on Saturday. Augsburg's win lifts them ten points clear of the relegation play-off place, and also confirms survival for Mainz, who beat local rivals Fortuna Duesseldorf 3-1. Jean-Philippe Mateta put Mainz into the lead after just 36 seconds, but Dodi Lukebakio levelled the scores with his second goal in two games. Lukebakio later missed a penalty, and Mainz took advantage of the let-off, sealing the win with second half goals from Mateta and Karim Onisiwo. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen and Hoffenheim kept themselves in the race for Europe with wins over Nuremberg and Schalke respectively. Goals from Lucas Alario and Kevin Volland saw Leverkusen labour to a 2-0 win agaisnt Nuremberg, while Hoffenheim romped to a 5-2 win in Gelsenkirchen. In-form Algerian midfielder Ishak Belfodil opened the scoring, and Andrej Kramaric doubled the lead just before half-time. Schalke briefly rallied thanks to a Daniel Caligiuri penalty and Guido Burgstaller picked up a late consolation goal, but second-half strikes from Adam Szalai, Nadiem Amiri and Belfodil saw Hoffenheim cruise to victory and tighten their grip on sixth place. ""We said that if we won our five remaining games, we could target a Champions League place, and now it is only four games,"" said Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann."
21,13/04/2019,17:38,Raffael puts Gladbach back in the race for top four,A second-half winner from Brazilian striker Raffael gave Borussia Moenchengladbach a 1-0 win over Hanover on Saturday and fresh hope of a top four finish in the Bundesliga.,"Gladbach have endured a turbulent few weeks of late, having dropped out of the top four and announced the impending departure of coach Dieter Hecking. The win over Hanover, only their second victory in nine games, marked a timely change in fortunes and keeps Gladbach in the race for Champions League football. They now sit in fifth, a point behind Eintracht Frankfurt, who play Augsburg on Sunday. Raffael grabbed the winner just after half-time, flicking a loose ball over the head of Hanover keeper Michael Esser. Bottom-of-the-table Hanover created little more than a handful of half-chances on the counter-attack, and failed to add to their meagre tally of 11 home goals this season. RB Leipzig, meanwhile, strengthened their grip on third with a comfortable win over Wolfsburg. Kevin Kampl curled in the opener on 16 minutes, before Timo Werner headed in a second to notch his third goal in four games. Defeat is a setback for Wolfsburg, whose fellow European hopefuls Bremen and Leverkusen both won on Saturday. Bremen snuck into a Europa League place thanks to a 2-1 win over Freiburg. Late headers from in-form Dutch midfielder Davy Klaassen and Theodor Gebre Selassie sealed the three points for the home side, despite Luca Waldschmidt's even later consolation goal for Freiburg. Leverkusen, meanwhile, battled to a 1-0 victory over relegation-threatened Stuttgart. Stuttgart keeper Ron-Robert Zieler kept out Kevin Volland with a brilliant reflex save before half-time, but could not stop Kai Havertz's coolly taken penalty just after the hour mark. Tempers flared late on as Stuttgart's Santiago Ascacibar clashed with Havertz and was sent off. Leverkusen sit between Bremen and Wolfsburg in seventh in what is proving to be a thrilling race for Europe. A single point separates Bremen in sixth from ninth-placed Hoffenheim, who play Hertha Berlin on Sunday."
22,11/04/2019,12:15,Stuttgart name super scout Sven Mislintat as director - report,"Former Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund star scout Sven Mislintat is set to join Bundesliga relegation candidates VfB Stuttgart as their sporting director, German media reported on Thursday.","According to reports in Kicker magazine and Bild newspaper, the 46-year-old will sign a three-year deal with the club and will be immediately tasked with a major squad overhaul at the relegation-threatened outfit. Mislintat rose to fame during his time at Borussia Dortmund, where he was credited with bringing the likes of Robert Lewandowski, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ousmane Dembele to the Westfalenstadion. Mislintat, who earned the nickname ""Diamond Eyes"" in Germany, later became head scout at Arsenal, where he oversaw the signings of Aubameyang, Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi. He left Arsenal in February after reportedly clashing with director of football Raul Sanllehi. At Stuttgart, who are third from bottom with six games left, Mislintat will work directly under former Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger, who replaced Michael Reschke as Head of Sport in February. Head coach Markus Weinzierl is set to remain at the Mercedes-Benz Arena despite a disappointing campaign for the five-time former Bundesliga winners. ""I spoke to the coaching team this week, and I told them that we would get through this together,"" Hitzlsperger told Sky on Saturday."
23,06/12/2018,12:33,"Pavard keeps mum amid Bayern, Liverpool and Napoli rumours",World Cup winner Benjamin Pavard said playing Champions League football remains the priority as he mulls leaving his beloved Germany or pushing through a move to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich.,"Pavard's status skyrocketed in the summer when he scored a superb goal in a 4-3 last-16 win over Argentina that set France on their way to World Cup glory in Russia. The 22-year-old defender has been at VfB Stuttgart since 2016 but seems unlikely to remain at the struggling side beyond this season, with a big-money move to Bayern among other ""concrete offers"" on the table. ""I haven't made promises to any clubs,"" Pavard told Sky Germany on Thursday. ""Maybe I will go (to Bayern) but I don't know what the future has in store for me. ""I've never hidden the fact that my ambition is to play in the Champions League."" Despite reports linking the centre-back to English giants Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as Napoli, Pavard's love affair with all things German could see him remain in the Bundesliga. ""I might just stay in Germany, but for the moment I want to focus on Stuttgart. I'm still here, we're in a difficult situation and I want to help us get out of it,"" he added. ""I like the people here and I fit in well...the mentality and the commitment, even at training, we never let up. ""That's how I like it. My mentality is German, I like this country a lot."" Stuttgart are currently third-bottom in the Bundesliga having won just three of their 13 games."
24,01/12/2018,20:41,Bayern up to third with first league win for a month,"Bayern Munich earned their first Bundesliga win for a month as Serge Gnabry scored twice in Saturday's 2-1 win at Werder Bremen, but the defending champions remained nine points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund.","Bayern's victory lifted them two places in the table to third, but they will drop back to fifth if Eintracht Frankfurt earn a fifth straight win at home to Wolfsburg on Sunday and RB Leipzig beat second-placed Moenchengladbach. Bayern built on their 5-1 midweek thrashing of Benfica in the Champions League, but still lag well behind Dortmund, who also won 2-0 at home against Freiburg. ""We know about the situation in the table - every game is important to get the three points and reduce the gap in the table,"" said Bayern goal-scorer Gnabry. ""The victories ensures a good mood and gives us confidence for our next game (against Nuremberg next Saturday). ""We didn't give much away - that gives us confidence."" The last time Bayern were so far behind in the table was in 2010/11, when Dortmund won the title, and their bid for a seventh straight Bundesliga crown is in danger after only their third win in their last nine league games. Gnabry, who started for Arjen Robben, put Bayern ahead on 20 minutes in Bremen after Joshua Kimmich's chip into the area shortly after the visitors had a penalty appeal turned down. Thomas Mueller then fired wide with the goal at his mercy, but Bayern's defensive frailties returned to haunt them as Bremen equalised 14 minutes later. Centre-back Jerome Boateng was out-leapt by Japan forward Yuya Osako after a pin-point accurate cross as Bremen drew level after midfielder Nuri Sahin had gone close. It was 1-1 at the break, but Bayern grabbed the winner five minutes into the second period when Mueller delayed his pass into the box for Gnabry to deflect the ball into the net. Bremen finished with 10 men when Niklas Moisander was sent off just before the final whistle for a second yellow card. However, there was more good news for Bayern as winger Kingsley Coman came on for his first appearance since tearing ankle ligaments on the opening day of the season in August. Likewise, Thiago Alcantara played the last 10 minutes after a month out with injury. In Dortmund, Paco Alcacer continued his phenomenal scoring run by netting his 10th goal of the season to become the league's top scorer. The Spaniard also equalled the Bundesliga record for most goals by a substitute in a season -- just 13 matches into the 2018/19 campaign -- with his ninth goal off the bench in his eighth league game. The ex-Barcelona forward has so far averaged a goal for Dortmund every 28 minutes. Dortmund went ahead when England teenager Jadon Sancho was brought down and Marco Reus hit his penalty attempt into the middle of the goal five minutes before half-time. Alcacer came on in the 70th minute and tapped home a minute into added time after brilliant play by Sancho and Lukasz Piszczek. ""It was logical that this would be a tough game for us, as Freiburg picked up a point (against Bayern) in Munich,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""They were very organised and compact, making it hard for us to find the holes, but luckily we were patient."" Hertha Berlin picked up their first win since stunning Bayern in September with a 2-0 win at Hanover. Berlin's captain Vedad Ibisevic heading home in the second-half after centre-back Jordan Torunarigha put them ahead in the first-half. Stuttgart moved off bottom place with a 1-0 win over mid-table Augsburg after striker Anastasios Donis scored their first-half winner. In the evening's game, Schalke, who qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, moved up three places to 11th with a 1-1 draw at Hoffenheim. Andre Kramaric's penalty for Hoffenheim in the second half was cancelled out by a spot-kcik from Schalke's Nabil Bentaleb 17 minutes from time."
25,19/09/2017,21:11,Raffael double seals Gladbach's home win,Brazil striker Raffael scored two second-half goals as Borussia Moechengladbach climbed the German league table on Tuesday after their 2-0 home win at home to Stuttgart.,"It was Stuttgart's first game since captain Christian Gentner suffered multiple facial fractures and concussion in a collision during Saturday's win over Wolfsburg. Gladbach's Raffael opened the scoring by finishing the move he started with a superb 57th minute goal after releasing Nico Elvedi on the wing and firing home the Swiss right-back's cross. The game was briefly halted with an hour gone as travelling Stuttgart fans set off flares in the away block which sent smoke across the pitch. When the game resumed after a three-minute delay, Stuttgart's Germany defender Dennis Aogo gave away a penalty when he held Belgium forward Thorgan Hazard back in the area with Gladbach on the attack. The 32-year-old Raffael then slotted his second when he drilled home the spot-kick on 74 minutes. Mid-table Stuttgart had a string of late chances to get back into the game, but Gladbach held on for only their second win in their opening five games which left them sixth. Third-placed Bayern Munich have the chance to go top for the first time in the fifth round of matches when the defending champions play Schalke in Gelsenkirchen. Current leaders Borussia Dortmund play Hamburg away on Wednesday."

The 32-year-old suffered fractures of the eye socket, the nose and the upper jaw when the knee of Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels caught him flush in the face late in Stuttgart's 1-0 Bundesliga win on Saturday. Gentner posted a picture of the unaffected left side of his face on Instagram on Monday, because the right is ""not really presentable"". ""First of all, the most important info for many people who have worried: I am very well, I have - as already mentioned - one or another breaks in the face, but nothing that could not be corrected again,"" he wrote. Only the quick reactions of Stuttgart's team doctor prevented a tragedy as Gentner, a former Germany international, had swallowed his tongue in the collision. Gentner hopes to be ""back playing again soon"", but Reschke says it was a miracle that he was not more seriously hurt. ""We really need to be happy that in some ways he got off lightly,"" said Reschke. As Gentner lay knocked-out on the pitch, ""my heart stopped. The terrible fears, which we all initially had, didn't come true. Thank God,"" added Reschke. Gentner is expected to be out for several months, but ""he will still be a very important figure for this team this season,"" added Reschke. The Stuttgart boss says he expects goalkeepers will rethink how they challenge for the ball in future. ""I think Casteels will not do the same thing again in the next match and that many other Bundesliga goalkeepers will be thinking about how they will go into challenges in the future, at least not with this aggressiveness,"" added Reschke."

New father Leckie nets twice on Hertha debut",New-father Mathew Leckie expected to celebrate breaking his year-long Bundesliga goal-drought by changing a few nappies after scoring twice on his Hertha Berlin debut on Saturday.,"The 27-year-old Socceroos star became a father a week ago when his partner gave birth to a daughter Olivia Valentina. ""I'll be going straight home to the baby,"" said the Australia striker when asked how he would celebrate his double against Stuttgart at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Leckie looked sharp, sprinting onto Vedad Ibisevic's header to fire home 30 seconds after the break, then netted from close range from a corner on 62 minutes to cap a dream debut in front of 44,751 fans in Berlin.

Having gone 2,178 minutes without a goal in Germany's top flight for former club Ingolstadt, who were relegated at the end of last season, Leckie is delighted to have already open his Hertha account. ""Football is a crazy, funny game. I think the fresh start in Berlin was exactly what I needed,"" said Leckie, whose previous Bundesliga goal was back in May 2016. ""I was frustrated at the end (in Ingolstadt), because I knew I had chances to score. ""At the end, it didn't matter what I did, because luck wasn't on my side."" Leckie insists he doesn't ""want to say anything bad about Ingolstadt"", but Berlin's style of play under head coach Pal Dardai clearly suits his game better. ""We'd rather have the ball, which makes things easier for the forwards,"" he added. ""Hopefully I have broken the curse."" Dardai praised ""wonderful"" Leckie for how quickly he has settled into the team, but was otherwise unhappy with Hertha's second-half performance and was grateful for the two-goal cushion. ""We came out of the break well and too the lead, but you need to have some confidence,"" said Dardai. ""Instead, we lost our composure, which not okay."""
30,04/08/2017,17:55,Injury-prone Badstuber signs for Stuttgart,Injury-prone Germany defender Holger Badstuber signed a one-year deal with newly-promoted VfB Stuttgart on Friday as the ex-Bayern Munich star looks to resurrect his flagging career at his former club.,"The 28-year-old played youth team football for Stuttgart from 2000-2002 and hoping to remain injury-free to help his new club re-establish themselves in Germany's top flight after winning the second division last season. ""No one should ever forget their roots and I never did,"" said Badstuber, who made the last of his 31 appearances for Germany in March 2015. ""VfB was and is something special for me and emotionally I immediately picked up where I left off."" Badstuber was without an employer in June when his six-month loan deal at Schalke expired. Neither Schalke nor previous employers Bayern were willing to offer a contract extension despite his experience of having made 129 Bundesliga and 37 Champions League appearances. Lady luck has not been kind and Badstuber has suffered a horrendous list of injuries since 2012. As a 21-year-old, he played for Germany at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and was in his prime when die Mannschaft reached the semi-finals of Euro 2012. However, he tore his cruciate knee ligament in December 2012, then repeated the injury five months later which saw him miss the entire 2013/14 season and cost him the best part of two years. He forced his way back into the Bayern team for the start of the 2014/15 season, then injured his thigh, meaning another long lay off before he ruptured his quadriceps in April 2015 during a Champions League game. Following that, he suffered an ankle injury in February 2016. Desperate for first-team football after falling down the pecking order at Bayern, Badstuber joined Schalke in January on loan, however despite playing 10 league matches neither club offered him a new contract. Originally, Badstuber had wanted to seek employment abroad to ""develop in another country, maybe learn a new language"", and had talks with Sevilla and Sporting Lisbon, but nothing came of it. Now his challenge is to ""cross off the last few years, start a new chapter and look forward, playing for a few years at the top level""."

It is an immediate return to the top flight for Stuttgart and Hanover after both were relegated last season. Third-placed Braunschweig could still join them in Germany's top flight for the 2017/18 campaign. Braunschweig face 2009 German champions Wolfsburg, who finished third from bottom in the Bundesliga, in a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off on May 25 and 29."
32,21/12/2016,13:40,US striker Green quits Bayern for Stuttgart,"USA international striker Julian Green will leave Bayern Munich for second division VfB Stuttgart in January's transfer window, the German league leaders announced on Wednesday.","With Poland hot-shot Robert Lewandowski as Bayern's first-choice striker, the 21-year-old Green has struggled for opportunities and has signed a deal with Stuttgart until June 2019. Green spent nearly seven years in Bayern's youth academy and reserve team. He played for the USA at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and, aged 19, became the youngest player to score at the finals by netting with his first touch of the ball in the 2-1 last 16 defeat to Belgium. Green is relishing joining fallen giants Stuttgart, who are third in Germany's second tier and chasing promotion at the first time of asking following their relegation from the Bundesliga in May. ""I came to Bayern in the Under-15 team and dreamed of becoming a professional, which I achieved,"" he said. ""In the last three years, I gained a lot of experience, for which I am grateful. ""Now I have new goals with Stuttgart and am looking forward to the challenge -- above all to support Stuttgart in the second half of the season."" Green, whose debut came in November 2013 against Russians CSKA Moscow, made two appearances for Bayern in each of the Champions League and German Cup, but never played in a Bundesliga match."

""He is very dangerous in front of goal, is comfortable with both feet and is very mobile."" Schindelmeiser said that fellow Japanese player Hajime Hosogai had ""helped a lot to bring Takuma to the club"". The 21-year-old signed for Arsenal in July from Sanfrecce Hiroshima with whom he was Japanese champion in 2015. The loan deal is valid for one season but could be extended. Asano will be playing in the second tier of German football after Stuttgart were relegated from the Bundesliga at the end of last season."
34,17/05/2016,18:39,"Dutt joins Stuttgart exodus, Luhukay takes charge","Jos Luhukay has been named as the new coach of VfB Stuttgart after their relegation to the German second tier, while Robin Dutt became the third senior figure to leave the club on Tuesday.","Director of sport Dutt became the latest victim of Stuttgart's first relegation for more than 40 years when he was dismissed after ex-coach Jurgen Kramny was sacked on Sunday, the same day president Bernd Wahler resigned. Stuttgart were relegated after Saturday's 3-1 defeat at Wolfsburg confirmed their demotion to the second division with Hanover 96, after failing to win any of their last nine games. Dutchman Luhukay, who has also coached Bundesliga sides Borussia Moenchengladbach, Augsburg and Hertha Berlin, has now been named as Kramny's successor. ""Jos Luhukay is a very experienced coach, who from his previous work with other clubs, has already demonstrated impressive qualities,"" said the club in a statement. ""We are convinced he is the right man for the job, regardless of any other personnel changes there will be."" The successor for Dutt, who joined Stuttgart in January 2015, is likely to be named next week. ""After some intensive discussions, we have decided the split from Robin Dutt was necessary to make the necessary fresh start for VfB,"" said Martin Schaefer, a member of Stuttgart's board. Kramny had even less time in his job than Dutt, as the 44-year-old only became head coach last November to replace the sacked Alexander Zorniger, but his contract was just valid for Germany's top flight. Stuttgart were relegated alongside Hanover, with Eintracht Frankfurt finishing third from bottom to go into the relegation play-off. Frankfurt play the first of two legs against Nuremberg, who came third in the second tier, on Thursday with the return match next Monday."

Kramny stands aside with a record of six wins, five draws and 10 defeats to leave the three-time Bundesliga champions in 17th and second-last spot in the end-of-season table. Stuttgart's proud record of 40 unbroken years in the top flight ended on Saturday with a 3-1 loss to Wolfsburg. On Saturday, Stuttgart's Australia goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak pulled off a string of saves, but it was not enough to deny the Wolves. Andre Schuerrle boosted his chances of making Germany's Euro 2016 squad on Tuesday with two goals as Wolfsburg caught Stuttgart on the counter-attack. Stuttgart forward Daniel Didavi sparked a late fightback with a 78th-minute goal. Stuttgart were relegated alongside bottom side Hanover 96, with Eintracht Frankfurt finishing third-bottom and going into a two-legged play-off against Nuremberg, who came third in the second tier."
36,07/05/2016,20:07,Fans' fury as Stuttgart face first drop in 40 years,Angry Stuttgart fans stormed the pitch after Saturday's 3-1 home defeat to Mainz left the club on the verge of a first relegation from the Bundesliga for 40 years.,"Hundreds of fans, many of whom were masked, stormed the pitch at the Mercedes Benz Arena after the final whistle to angrily jostle their team's players, who were quickly escorted off the pitch by security staff. The defeat left Stuttgart second from bottom in the table and unable to secure safety in the regular season. They are two points from the relegation play-off spot, before they play Wolfsburg away next Saturday in their final game of the campaign. The two clubs immediately above them play each other next Saturday, when Werder Bremen host Eintracht Frankfurt. Stuttgart need Frankfurt to beat Bremen and to get a win at Wolfsburg to go into the relegation play-off. If that does not happen then Stuttgart, who won the Bundesliga title in 2007, will find themselves relegated to the second division for the first time since the 1974/75 season. ""I can understand it,"" said Stuttgart defender Kevin Grosskreutz, who was fighting back tears after the fans' pitch invasion. ""We are responsible for the defeat. I'm speechless and I'm so sorry."" Coach Jurgen Kramny admitted it was a ""very, very bitter"" defeat after his side threw away an early lead given to them by Christian Gentner with only six minutes gone, as Mainz roared back with goals by Yunus Malli, Jhon Cordoba and Karim Onisiwo. ""It's not over yet, but it's very difficult,"" added Kramny. ""We need a miracle and we have to fight until the last minute. ""Giving up is not an option."" Fifth-placed Mainz are on course for the Europa League next season. ""That wasn't much of a performance from us,"" fumed Stuttgart's Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak, who played his first Bundesliga game of the season after a knee operation to remove a cyst last August."

Bremen took an early lead when Bartel netted after just 10 minutes, but Stuttgart's Daniel Didavi slotted home from ten metres out just before the half hour mark. Stuttgart's Italian defender Federico Barba headed into his own net on 33 minutes, then Werder midfielder Levin Oztunali made it 3-1 by netting just before the break. Barba made amends for his earlier error on 53 minutes when he fired home between the legs of Bremen defender Jannik Vestergaard to leave Stuttgart 3-2 behind. But Werder made sure of the win when the 37-year-old Pizarro netted his 14th league goal of the season by firing home from 15 metres out on 64 minutes. Bremen claimed two goals in the final ten minutes as Bartels grabbed his second on 80 minutes, then Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah came on for Pizarro and scored four minutes later. Bremen now play Cologne away on Saturday before hosting Eintracht Frankfurt at home on the final day of the season on May 14. Stuttgart, the 2007 German champions, are home to seventh-placed Mainz on Saturday, then play Wolfsburg away in their bid to stay up."
38,30/04/2016,18:35,Bayern made to wait for historic fourth title in row,Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich must wait to have their historic fourth consecutive Bundesliga title confirmed after being held to a 1-1 draw at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.,"The champagne had to be put back on ice at the Allianz Arena after Thomas Mueller's first-half header for Bayern was cancelled out by Andre Hahn's superb second-half strike for Gladbach. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund romped to a 5-1 win at home against Wolfsburg to trim Bayern's lead at the top to five points with two games left. Bayern are away to mid-table Ingolstadt next Saturday, then host relegated Hanover on the final day of the season in a fortnight. The draw with Gladbach comes three days before Tuesday's crunch Champions League home semi-final against Atletico Madrid with Bayern having lost the first leg 1-0 away last Wednesday. ""Of course, we had wanted to win today, for our fans and for ourselves,"" said Guardiola. ""We need just a point now, a draw, or a win to secure the title. ""But now there's time to concentrate on Atletico Madrid, it will be a different game on Tuesday. We must play better."" Bayern were punished for sitting back after Mueller's sixth-minute headed opener. Gladbach, one of only two clubs to beat Bayern in the German league this season, hit back when Hahn slotted home on 72 minutes having gone close just moments before. A superb pass from Lars Stindl put Hahn in behind the Bayern defence and he wrong-footed Medhi Benatia before firing his shot past Manuel Neuer. There was some good news for Bayern as Jerome Boateng played his first game since January. The Germany defender is now in line to face Diego Simeone's Atletico with a place in the Champions League final on May 28 at stake. In Dortmund, Borussia hammered Wolfsburg with Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa scoring their first and creating their second before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came off the bench to score twice. The Gabon striker now has 25 league goals this season, leaving him two short of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski. Dortmund took the lead when Henrikh Mkhitaryan's bullet pass was deflected home by Kagawa, who then set up Ramos to leave Dortmund 2-0 up inside nine minutes. Marco Reus grabbed their third by chipping home with an hour gone. Aubameyang replaced Ramos on 69 minutes and scored his first just eight minutes later when Mkhitaryan's pass found him unmarked to header home, then netted a second header just a minute later before Wolfsburg's Andre Schuerrle scored a consolation. At the other end of the table, Hanover 96's relegation was confirmed by their 3-1 defeat to Schalke. Eintracht Frankfurt boosted their survival hopes with a 2-1 win at Darmstadt to go 16th, which carries a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off at the end of the season. But 17th-placed Werder Bremen can push Frankfurt back down the table if they beat VfB Stuttgart, who are 15th, at home on Monday in a crunch relegation battle. Mid-table Hamburg played out a goalless draw at home to Mainz, who stay seventh and on course for a Europa League place. Hoffenheim looked to have escaped relegation under 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest in the Bundesliga's history, and they are four points from the drop zone, after their 2-1 win at home to Ingolstadt."
39,23/04/2016,17:51,Bayern made to wait for historic fourth straight title,Bayern Munich must wait another week to claim an historic fourth consecutive Bundesliga title although Saturday's 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin left them seven points clear with three games left.,"Bayern could have had the league wrapped up in the capital had second-placed Dortmund not won 3-0 at VfB Stuttgart. That result means Pep Guardiola's Bavarians will secure the title if they beat Borussia Moechengladbach at home next Saturday regardless of other results. No other team has even won four consecutive league titles in Germany's top flight. Bayern took the lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium when Mario Goetze's pass found Vidal in space. The Chile midfielder drilled home his shot from 22 metres, which took a deflection on it's way past Berlin goalkeeper Thomas Kraft on 48 minutes. Brazil winger Douglas Costa doubled Bayern's lead with a breath-taking strike from the right flank which looped over the Hertha goalkeeper on 79 minutes. But this was a far from polished performance from Bayern, ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first-leg, at Atletico Madrid. They managed just six shots on goal, compared to Hertha's nine, despite the hosts being restricted to just 26 percent possession. Dortmund, who will face the Bavarians in the German Cup final on May 21, made Bayern wait a little longer to have their title win confirmed with a comprehensive win at Stuttgart. Borussia were 2-0 up at the break after Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa netted early on, then 17-year-old Christian Pulisic scored for the second week running. Just before half-time he tapped home after Henrikh Mkhitaryan's shot from outside the area was blocked by Stuttgart's Poland goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton. Mkhitaryan made it 3-0 when he fired home after Kagawa's cross to striker Adrian Ramos, in for the injured Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, was blocked by Tyton on 56 minutes. Wolfsburg's miserable league form continues as they are now six Bundesliga games without a win after crashing 2-0 at home to Augsburg. Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason, on loan from Olympiakos, scored his sixth league goal in ten games, with a minute gone, then set up Turkey international Halil Altintop on 57 minutes. The defeat sees Wolfsburg drop to tenth in the table while Augsburg are now five points clear of the relegation places. Cologne are up to ninth after backing up their 3-2 comeback win over Mainz with a 4-1 thumping of Darmstadt as French striker Anthony Modeste and winger Marcel Risse both scored twice. Hanover have only a mathematical chance of avoiding relegation after Japan internationals Hiroki Sakai and Hiroshi Kiyotake scored in their 2-2 draw with 10-man Ingolstadt. Ingolstadt played for 70 minutes with ten men after French defender Romain Bregerie was sent off for hauling down Hanover midfielder Felix Klaus. Alfredo Morales and Moritz Hartmann had hosts Ingolstadt 2-0 up with only 25 minutes gone. Defender Sakai fired home on 58 minutes before midfielder Kiyotake made sure Hanover claimed a point with the equaliser eight minutes from time. On Friday, Pierre-Michel Lasogga struck twice as Hamburg eased their Bundesliga relegation fears with a 2-1 victory at home to Werder Bremen, who remain stuck in the bottom three."

With your support it will be easier for me. I want to thank every single fan, club and companion in my last 17 years as a professional footballer,"" Hildebrand wrote on his Facebook page. The ex-Germany shot-stopper is without a club and has decided to hang up his gloves after a move to an MLS club in the United States fell through. Hildebrand set the German league record in nine games, bridging the 2002/03 and 2003/04 seasons. ""This record was part of an outstanding team performance. If anyone manages to beat it, it will be Bayern and Manuel,"" Hildebrand magazine Kicker. Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer came closest to beating Hildebrand's figure in 2011 when he went 770 minutes unbeaten in the German league. Hildebrand won the last of his seven caps for Germany in 2007 and made 301 appearances in the Bundesliga for VfB Stuttgart, Hoffenheim, Schalke 04 and Eintracht Frankfurt. He also had spells at Valencia and Sporting Lisbon after winning the Bundesliga title with Stuttgart in the 2006/07 season. He last played in Germany's top flight for Frankfurt in December 2014 and has decided to retire after a long recovery period following a hip operation in April 2015. ""I love football, but I am at an age when one is allowed to stop,"" he added. ""Apart from that, my health is important to me and I want to be able to have a bit of a kick around with my son."" Hildebrand has signed up to study for his coaching licence and says he may well work for VfB Stuttgart in the future. ""I am rooted to the club and can well imagine doing something at VfB in the future. I have good contacts,"" he said. For now he is busy with projects in sports business and event management and is a partner in a supermarket chain of vegan food."

Augsburg took an shock lead at their WKK Arena when Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason slotted home Brazilian winger Caiuby's cross on 16 minutes. But Dortmund winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan dragged his side back into the game with an equaliser just before the half-time whistle after superb passing from Marco Reus and Nuri Sahin. Ramos then came into his own, showing great skill in chesting down Mats Hummels' long ball for replacement Gonzalo Castro to fire home on 69 minutes. The Colombia international then netted on 75 minutes to give Dortmund the three points that keep them in touch with Pep Guardiola's Bayern. The defeat leaves Augsburg just above the relegation places on goal difference. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen rejoined the fight for a Champions League qualifying berth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart that saw them break back into the top six. Goals by Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi handed Leverkusen a win that put them level on points with fifth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach and two points behind Schalke, who sit in the fourth place that offers a spot in next season's Champions League play-offs. Germany Under-21 star Brandt gave the vistors the lead at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena on 11 minutes when he finished off a flowing attack. Bellarabi celebrated his call-up to the Germany squad for the forthcoming internationals against England and Italy by adding Leverkusen's second on 49 minutes. Brandt, 19, could have claimed his second of the game, but his shot hit the post when he got away from the Stuttgart defence with an hour gone. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski's 25th league goal of the season gave leaders Bayern Munich a 1-0 win at Cologne. Hertha Berlin remain on course to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1999/2000 after a 2-1 victory over Ingolstadt in the capital kept them four points clear of Schalke in third. Wolfsburg, who will face Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals next month, needed a last-minute Andre Schuerrle equaliser to grab a 1-1 draw at home to Darmstadt as they stay eighth.

""That's bitter news both for us and Kevin,"" admitted Stuttgart's coach Jurgen Kramny, whose side face Bayer Leverkusen and league leaders Bayern Munich in the coming weeks. Grosskreutz won the last of his six appearances for Germany in 2014 and was part of the squad which won the World Cup in Brazil, but was not expected to part of Joachim Low's plans for Euro 2016 in France this June. Grosskreutz has vowed to come back stronger after a series of impressive displays in the Bundesliga since joining Stuttgart in January. ""I will come back. I have often had crap to deal with in the past,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""So often in the past, knockers and critics had their fun at my expense, but I will show these very people that nothing upsets me."" Grosskreutz stayed on the pitch in Ingolstadt and played the full 90 minutes as his injury occurred after Stuttgart had made the last of their three substitutions with 74 minutes gone. ""He couldn't have taken another step,"" said Kramny. ""Kevin has integrated himself well into the team and put in some good performances with his passion and commitment."" Grosskreutz joined Stuttgart and returned to Germany after a disasterous switch from Borussia Dortmund to Galatasaray last September. World football's governing body FIFA said the paperwork had not been submitted in time, meaning Grosskreutz could not play in official competition and he left Istanbul without having played a single game for the Turkish giants. But a series of strong displays for his new club helped Stuttgart climb up from the Bundesliga's relegation spots to mid-table."

In his absence, Mkhitaryan showed superb individual skill for the winner at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. With Marcel Schmelzer screaming up in support on his left, Mkhitaryan cut back inside and curled his right-footed shot around Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler on 57 minutes. With Pep Guardiola's Bayern at Augsburg on Sunday, Dortmund remain second while Hanover are rooted to the bottom, seven points from safety. Wolfsburg warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League, last 16, first-leg at Ghent with a 2-0 win at home to Ingolstadt to pick up their first victory since knocking Manchester United out of Europe in December. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg won for the first time in six games but stay eighth after first-half goals goals by Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and defender Robin Knoche. Bayer Leverkusen moved up from seventh to third as they bounced back from their shock German Cup exit at the hands of Werder Bremen in mid-week with a 2-1 comeback win at Darmstadt. On a heavy pitch, Sandro Wagner stabbed the ball home to give Darmstadt an early lead, despite Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno catching him around the throat with his forearm. Leverkusen drew level when Darmstadt defender Aytac Sulu headed into his own net on 62 minutes. The visitors then took the lead with a sweeping move which went the length of the pitch. From a Darmstadt corner, junior Julian Brandt started the move he finished by tapping home Kevin Kampl's final pass for the winner on 77 minutes. VfB Stuttgart's impressive form continued as they picked up their fifth-straight league win to go ninth with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. A long-range strike from Ivory Coast defensive midfielder Serey Die and a second-half goal from left-wing Filip Kostic sealed the hosts' win. Hertha suffered their first defeat in nine games since losing 2-0 at Bayern in November to drop to fourth. The youngest manager in Bundesliga history made his debut when Julian Nagelsmann, 28, was on Hoffenheim's bench for their 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen in the basement battle. Nagelsmann took over after predecessor Huub Stevens resigned on Wednesday due to heart problems. Despite Hoffenheim taking the lead on 10 minutes through Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, Werder hit back three minutes later as former Chelsea defender Papy Djilobodji scored his first Bremen goal. The result leaves both teams in the relegation places."

After boycotting the first 20 rows of the away section, Dortmund fans then threw the brightly-coloured balls onto the pitch midway through the first-half which Borussia players, led by captain Mats Hummels, had to pick up as the game was briefly halted. ""Football must be affordable!"" read one banner in the away section as the cheapest ticket for Tuesday's match was 38.50 euros, plus booking fee, while the most expensive were more than 70 euros. ""We wanted to try and put a good face on the matter, but at the same time show that it was not on,"" said Marc Quambusch, the initiative's spokesman. The fans carried out the protest with Dortmund's blessing. ""It's the case that VfB Stuttgart raised the prices for tickets by 25 percent, with prices around 70 euros,"" said Dortmund's press officer Sascha Fligge in the pre-match press conference. ""The fans are very critical of this and we support them."" Stuttgart said they had put prices up for away fans after Dortmund had done exactly the same thing for a Bundesliga match between the clubs at Borussia's Signal Iduna Stadium. Ticket prices are an issue in England's Premier League after 10,000 fans walked out of Liverpool's 2-2 draw at home to Sunderland last Saturday over the £77 ($112, 99 euros) it will cost for the most expensive match ticket at Anfield next season. Prices remain reasonable in Germany's top flight where tickets range from 16.70 to 78.20 euros for a home Bundesliga match at Borussia Dortmund, while Bayern Munich charge from 15 up to 70 euros for home league games."
46,10/02/2016,11:50,Dortmund fans call foul on Stuttgart's cup ticket prices,Borussia Dortmund fans called 'foul' on away ticket prices for their team's German Cup quarter-final at Stuttgart by hurling dozens of yellow and red balls onto the pitch.,"Dortmund fans took exception after Stuttgart raised ticket prices at the Mercedes Benz Arena for Tuesday night's game as Borussia booked their place in the last four with a 3-1 win over their hosts. After boycotting the first 20 rows of the away section, Dortmund fans then threw the brightly-coloured balls onto the pitch midway through the first-half which Borussia players, led by captain Mats Hummels, had to pick up as the game was briefly halted. ""Football must be affordable!"" read one banner in the away section as the cheapest ticket for Tuesday's match was 38.50 euros, plus booking fee, while the most expensive were more than 70 euros. ""We wanted to try and put a good face on the matter, but at the same time show that it was not on,"" said Marc Quambusch, the initiative's spokesman. The fans carried out the protest with Dortmund's blessing. ""It's the case that VfB Stuttgart raised the prices for tickets by 25 percent, with prices around 70 euros,"" said Dortmund's press officer Sascha Fligge in the pre-match press conference. ""The fans are very critical of this and we support them."" Stuttgart said they had put prices up for away fans after Dortmund had done exactly the same thing for a Bundesliga match between the clubs at Borussia's Signal Iduna Stadium. Ticket prices are an issue in England's Premier League after 10,000 fans walked out of Liverpool's 2-2 draw at home to Sunderland last Saturday over the £77 ($112, 99 euros) it will cost for the most expensive match ticket at Anfield next season.

Aubameyang has now scored in each of Dortmund's last seven German Cup games, dating back to the start of last season, having also netted in Dortmund's 3-1 Cup final defeat to Wolfsburg last May. ""Auba knows how to take his chances and he works hard on his finishing every day,"" said Reus. ""It's fun to play alongside him."" Dortmund are in the semi-finals for the third season in a row while spirited Stuttgart had their five-match winning streak, dating back to mid-December, ended. Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich will attempt to join Dortmund in the last four when they play VfL Bochum on Wednesday while minnows Heidenheim host Hertha Berlin. Dortmund took the lead at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena when Reus fired home off the crossbar with just five minutes gone. Stuttgart fought back and levelled when Lukas Rupp's shot deflected off Mkhitaryan and into the Dortmund net on 21 minutes to the home fans' delight. The visitors regained the lead when Reus set up Aubameyang for his 30th in all competitions, on 31 minutes as Stuttgart failed to cope with Dortmund's pace. With time running out, Aubameyang broke clear and pulled Stuttgart goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak off his line to allow Mkhitaryan a simple tap-in on 89 minutes. Earlier, veteran Claudio Pizarro helped seal Werder Bremen's 3-1 quarter-final win at ten-man Bayer Leverkusen by playing a key role in their shock victory. There was a strong Latin American flavour at Leverkusen's BayArena as Bremen booked their place in April's semi-finals. Mexico's Javier Hernandez put Leverkusen ahead, then Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia levelled before Brazilian defender Wendell was sent off for Bayer just before the half-time break. After Wendall's dismissal, Peru's 37-year-old striker Pizarro scored Bremen's second by converting the resulting penalty, then set up their third. ""We did very well defensively and we reacted as a unit after conceding a goal,"" beamed Pizarro. ""Now we get to go further in the Cup."" Leverkusen took the lead when ex-Manchester United forward Hernandez continued his record of scoring in each round of the cup. It was his 22nd goal for Bayer this season in all competitions. After Stefan Kiessling was up-ended by Bremen's Spanish defender Alejandro Galvez in the area, 'Chicharito' rifled home the resulting penalty in the 22nd minute. The lead lasted nine minutes as Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia put Werder level by hitting the bottom left-hand corner of Leverkusen's net to make it 1-1. Disaster struck for the hosts when Wendell was shown a straight red for hauling down Bartels, who was through on goal, just before the break The 37-year-old Pizarro, who last weekend became the first foreign player to make 400 Bundesliga appearances, hit his eighth goal of the season. Pizarro then played a big part in Bremen's third as his shot was saved by Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno, but Florian Grillitsch tapped home the rebound on 82 minutes."
48,08/02/2016,12:30,Inked up Grosskreutz hoping to knockout ex-club Dortmund,Stuttgart's World Cup winner Kevin Grosskreutz is relishing his new club's German Cup quarter-final at home to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday as he looks to knock his ex-club out.,"Such is Grosskreutz's passion for Dortmund that he has a tattoo of the city's skyline on his right calf and Borussia's 2011 and 2012 German league titles celebrated in ink on his left shoulder. ""For me personally, it's a special feeling to run out against Dortmund,"" Grosskreutz said having made 178 league appearances for Borussia, whom he left in September. ""It was my club and I'm looking forward to seeing my friends again,"" he said before adding ""but we won't be friends on the pitch"". ""I'm from there and really looking forward to the game. ""We'll put everything in so that we can pull off a surprise. We want to reach the next round. ""Dortmund have a world-class team, it's not for no reason that they're second (in the Bundesliga), but we believe in our chances."" According to Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, Grosskreutz ""embodied"" what the club is about, even if he courted controversy during his six years as a Dortmund player by urinating in a Berlin hotel's foyer and throwing a kebab at a fan in Cologne during separate late-night incidents. The 27-year-old was part of Germany's World Cup squad, but didn't play a single minute of Brazil 2014 and will be up against former Borussia team-mates he only waved goodbye to a few months ago. The right-back will be tasked with ensuring Dortmund's Germany star Marco Reus has a quiet game on the left wing and that striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fails to add to his tally of 29 goals in all competitions this season. Grosskreutz has been a revelation since signing for Stuttgart in January, helping his new club to three wins in as many games, after an unhappy three-month stint at Galatasaray when he did not play a competitive game. Having been a Dortmund regular under Jurgen Klopp, Grosskreutz left at the start of the current season due to a lack of opportunities under new coach Thomas Tuchel. ""There won't be much time for a chat, but there are no personal reservations,"" said Tuchel. Grosskreutz switched to Istanbul's Galatasaray in late August, but a problem with the paperwork before the transfer window closed meant he could not play in competitive games for the Turkish club for the rest of 2015. Homesickness kicked in and Grosskreutz seized the chance to return to the Bundesliga with Stuttgart in January. ""I was made to feel super welcome in the team and feel really well in the city and in the stadium,"" he said. ""In the league, it is all about staying up and we aren't talking about anything else, but of course we want to try and take something out of Tuesday."" He is not Stuttgart's only ex-Dortmund player looking forward to playing last season's German Cup finalists. Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak is set to make his first start for Stuttgart having been plagued with injury since his transfer before the start of the season. Resurgent Stuttgart will test high-flying Dortmund, having won all of their last five matches since needing extra-time to beat Eintracht Braunschweig 3-2 in the third round of the German Cup last December. League wins over Wolfsburg, Cologne, Hamburg and Eintracht Frankfurt have catapulted 2007 German league champions Stuttgart from the relegation places to 12th in the Bundesliga table."
49,06/01/2016,18:27,Stuttgart bring Grosskreutz back to Bundesliga,"German international winger Kevin Grosskreutz has returned to the Bundesliga, joining VfB Stuttgart after an unhappy stint in Turkey with Galatasaray.","Stuttgart announced the signing of the 27-year-old former Borussia Dortmund player from their winter training camp in the Turkish resort of Belek. ""The Bundesliga is one of the strongest leagues in the world along with the Premier League. I can't wait to get stuck in and help VfB reach their objectives,"" said Grosskreutz, who can also play as a full-back. Grosskreutz, an unused squad member when Germany won the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, has signed a contract until June 2018 with Stuttgart, who lie 15th in the Bundesliga table. The transfer ends a disappointing spell in Turkey, when an administrative hold-up meant he was prevented from playing for Galatasaray by FIFA before January 1. He is Stuttgart's second January signing following the arrival of Ukraine forward Artem Kravets from Dynamo Kiev."
50,20/12/2015,16:47,Stuttgart hand caretaker coach Kramny a two-year deal,"Strugglers VfB Stuttgart on Sunday handed caretaker coach Juergen Kramny a two-year contract, less than 24 hours after their shock German league win over Champions League side Wolfsburg.","Stuttgart climbed out of the relegation places on goal difference on Saturday with a 3-1 win over Wolves, thanks to two goals by Daniel Didavi and one from Serbia international Filip Kostic. It was just their first league win since the start of November and only their fourth in 17 games this season, but Kramny has proven himself and is undefeated in his last four games since taking charge after Alexander Zorniger was sacked. Stuttgart's director of sport Robin Dutt has extended Kramny's stay as head coach, but gave the first-team a warning as they headed off into the month-long winter break with training set to resume on January 4. ""Now the team must prove that things can continue as they have in the last few weeks,"" said Dutt with Stuttgart 15th in the table of the 18 teams in Germany's top flight. ""This isn't down to the win over Wolfsburg, but it didn't do things any harm either."" Stuttgart have only narrowly avoided relegation for the last two seasons and have drawn Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals of the German Cup in February."
51,29/11/2015,17:50,Aubameyang nets twice as Dortmund see off Stuttgart,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice on Sunday as second-placed Borussia Dortmund dropped captain Mats Hummels and returned to winning ways with a 4-1 win at home to VfB Stuttgart.,"Gabon striker Aubameyang cemented his status as the Bundesliga's top scorer with his 16th and 17th league goals in 14 games this season after Gonzalo Castro had headed Borussia into an early lead. Daniel Didavi pulled a goal back for strugglers Stuttgart with half-time approaching. But a Georg Niedermeier own-goal left the visitors 3-1 down before Aubameyang grabbed their superb fourth goal and his second to inflict a third straight defeat on Stuttgart. Hummels dominated the pre-match talk, because, despite his status as a World Cup winner with Germany, he found himself on the bench at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park in the wake of poor performances. He scored an own goal in Dortmund's shock 3-1 defeat at Hamburg ten days ago in the Bundesliga, then conceded the penalty which sealed their 1-0 defeat on Thursday at Russia's FK Krasnodar in the Europa League group stages. The 26-year-old came on for the final 10 minutes against Stuttgart for Germany winger Marco Reus with Dortmund 3-1 up. Stuttgart's caretaker coach Jurgen Kramny got off to a losing start after replacing Alexander Zorniger in the wake of last weekend's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg and the defeat kept his side third from bottom. Dortmund trimmed Bayern Munich's lead to eight points after the runaway league leaders ground out a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin thanks to goals by Germany forward Thomas Mueller and France Under-21 winger Kingsley Coman on Saturday. Bayern show no signs of loosening their iron grip on the Bundesliga title. They picked up their 13th win from 14 league games to give them 40 from a possible 42 points and this was the first time in eight home games that Bayern failed to score at least four goals. Like Aubameyang, Mueller, who has 13 goals, has already equalled his tally for the whole of last season with less than half the campaign gone. Hertha, who last won in Munich in 1977, are in fifth place after Borussia Moechengladbach leap-frogged them into fourth with a 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Gladbach's head coach Andre Schubert preserved his nine-game unbeaten record since taking charge two months ago as USA international Fabian Johnson scored Borussia's late equaliser. Hamburg are up to sixth after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Hamburg raced into an early 2-0 lead as Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic scored on their opening attack, then striker Michael Gregoritsch doubled their lead on 26 minutes. Nigeria's Anthony Ujah pulled a goal back for Werder on 62 minutes, then Germany forward Nicolai Mueller made it 3-1 to Hamburg on 68 minutes when Ilicevic's final pass put him in behind the hosts' defence. Hanover eased the pressure on coach Michael Frontzeck with a 4-0 thumping at home to Ingolstadt which lifted them up to 14th and pulled them away from the relegation zone. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored his seventh goal of the season in Mainz's 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. His forward partner Yunus Malli added their second to claim his eighth while Frankfurt had captain Alex Meier sent off for a second yellow card."
52,28/11/2015,17:54,Bayern extend Hertha's 38-year wait,Bayern Munich went 11 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin who have now gone 38 years without a win at the German giants.,"With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting VfB Stuttgart on Sunday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead with first-half goals by Germany forward Thomas Mueller and France Under-21 winger Kingsley Coman. Bayern show no signs of loosening their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title as they picked up their 13th win from 14 league games to give them 40 from a possible 42 points. This was the first time in eight home games that Bayern failed to score at least four goals. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola experimented with the starting line-up by pushing Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng into a midfield role, which led to their second goal. They took the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal's cross found Medhi Benatia, whose shot was heading wide, but Mueller was on hand to head home on 34 minutes. Bayern doubled their lead on 41 minutes when Boateng lobbed the ball into Javi Martinez, whose pass found Coman and the French winger did the rest to make it 2-0 at the break. Hertha, who last won in Munich in 1977, are in fifth place after Borussia Moechengladbach leap-frogged them into fourth with a 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Gladbach's head coach Andre Schubert preserved his nine-game unbeaten record in the lead since taking charge two months ago. Borussia took an early lead thanks to USA international Fabian Johnson, who then scored their equaliser to rescue a point. Hoffenheim, chasing their first win since September, took a 3-1 lead just after the break thanks to goals by Steven Zuber, Eugen Polanski and Nadiem Amiri. But Swiss striker Josip Drmic pulled it back to 3-2 for Gladbach before Johnson claimed his second with a superb shot three minutes from time. Hamburg are up to sixth after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Hamburg raced into an early 2-0 lead as Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic scored on their opening attack, then striker Michael Gregoritsch doubled their lead on 26 minutes. Nigeria's Anthony Ujah pulled a goal back for Werder on 62 minutes, then Germany forward Nicolai Mueller made it 3-1 to Hamburg on 68 minutes when Ilicevic's final pass put him in behind the hosts' defence. Hanover eased the pressure on coach Michael Frontzeck with a 4-0 thumping at home to Ingolstadt which lifted them up to 14th and pulled them away from the relegation zone.

53,21/11/2015,17:53,Wolfsburg warm-up for Moscow by hammering Bremen,Germany striker Max Kruse netted twice in Wolfsburg's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen in the German league on Saturday to warm-up for Wednesday's key Champions League clash in Moscow.,"In Europe, Wolfsburg are third in Group B, but just a point behind leaders Manchester United ahead of their penultimate group game at bottom side CSKA Moscow in the Russian capital on Wednesday. The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes. Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes before completing the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross from Germany team-mate Andre Schuerrle to leave him with five league goals for the season. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 3-1 at Hamburg on Friday night, while leaders Bayern Munich play at Schalke on Saturday evening. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez now has 12 goals for Bayer Leverkusen in all competitions after scoring twice in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for 'Chicharito' in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the grateful Hernandez stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when a Hakan Calhanoglu pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic slammed in a powerful header on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu made sure of the three points by scoring Leverkusen's third on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Woeful defending by the hosts allowed Augsburg to race into an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes. The Rhine derby finished goalless as Mainz drew at Cologne as the hosts abandoned plans to play in a special-edition carnival-themed shirt out of respect for those who died in Paris."
54,07/11/2015,18:39,Bayern rout Stuttgart to extend league lead,Robert Lewandowski claimed his 14th Bundesliga goal of the season on Saturday as Bayern Munich went eight points clear with a 4-0 win over VfB Stuttgart.,"Bayern's star-studded attack ran riot at the Allianz Arena with Arjen Robben, Douglas Costa and Thomas Mueller also getting on the scoresheet as defeat pushed Stuttgart back into the bottom three. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting Schalke on Sunday in the Ruhr derby, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead. Pep Guardiola's Bayern picked up where they left off on Wednesday in the 5-1 rout of Arsenal in the Champions League. ""It's so difficult to play every three days and show this sort of mentality,"" said Guardiola, with Bayern targeting a repeat of their 2013 treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup. ""I hope they keep this aggression up until the winter break (in December) and then until the end of the season, because if we don't win the treble, it will have been a bad season."" The Bavarian giants have now claimed 34 points from 36 and are the only unbeaten team in Germany's top flight. They took the lead just 11 minutes in after creating a five-on-one attacking opportunity. Although Robben netted the goal, he had Arturo Vidal, Lewandowski and Mueller lining up to score behind him. Costa then doubled the tally with a long-range strike on 18 minutes. Poland's Lewandowski made it 3-0 on 37 minutes by volleying home Mueller's cross, which made him the league's top scorer, then the Germany forward grabbed the fourth with a header on 40 minutes. Bayern have turned the Allianz Arena into a fortress by scoring 28 goals in their last six home games, conceding just three. Third-placed Wolfsburg, last season's runners-up, are now 13 points adrift of Bayern after crashing to a 2-0 defeat at Mainz as Pablo de Blasis and Yunus Mali scored. Wolfsburg were reduced to 10 men when Germany midfielder Julian Draxler was sent off inside the opening 15 minutes for kung-fu kicking Chile defender Gonzalo Jara while competing for the ball. It capped a bad week for Wolves, who were usurped by Manchester United at the top of their Champions League group following their 2-0 defeat at Eindhoven. Fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen also suffered a second loss after being beaten 2-1 at home to neighbours Cologne in the Rhine derby. Defender Dominic Maroh scored both of Cologne's goals while Leverkusen's Javier Hernandez scored for the sixth match running to give him 12 goals since joining from Manchester United. Leverkusen were reduced to 10 men when defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a red card for bringing down Cologne striker Anthony Modeste when he was through on goal. Hoffenheim remain second from bottom after their goalless draw with Eintracht Frankfurt while Hamburg drew 1-1 at Darmstadt as Pierre-Michel Lasogga's first-half penalty was cancelled out by Marcel Heller's equaliser for hosts Darmstadt. Borussia Moenchengladbach had their six-match winning streak under caretaker coach Andre Schubert ended by a goalless draw at home to Ingolstadt. On Friday, Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou grabbed a hat-trick to steer Hertha Berlin to a 3-1 win at Hanover and into the top four. The 30-year-old former Chelsea star found the target in the 33rd and 60th minutes before completing his hat-trick with a penalty three minutes from time. Kalou now has seven goals in the Bundesliga this season while Japan's Hiroshi Kiyotake scored Hanover's only goal with a 70th-minute spot-kick."
55,06/11/2015,02:25,Stuttgart out to avoid a thumping at Bayern,Goals are set to fly on Saturday as the Bundesliga's most potent attack meets the league's worst defence when leaders Bayern Munich host strugglers VfB Stuttgart in Germany's southern derby.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern are five points clear at the top of the table and are Germany's only unbeaten team after 11 matches while Stuttgart are just above the relegation places. Bayern's star-studded attack inflicted a record 5-1 defeat on Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday as Thomas Mueller netted twice. Between them Germany's Mueller and Poland hot-shot Robert Lewandowski have netted 31 goals between them in all competitions, including 23 in Germany's top-flight. In contrast, Stuttgart only hauled themselves out of the bottom three last week and their leaky defence has conceded 23 goals so far -- the joint worst record in the Bundesliga alongside bottom side Augsburg. Stuttgart have lost their last 13 matches against Bayern in all competitions. They will be missing key midfielder Martin Harnik, who needs an operation on a knee injury, but Australia winger Robbie Kruse is set to return from a hamstring strain. ""Our goal is to take a point,"" said Stuttgart coach Alexander Zorniger, who was talking up his side's chances by insisting 'any side is beatable'. Bayern dropped their first points of the season last Friday when they were held to a goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt, who packed defenders behind the ball. But Zorniger was realistic about his side's chances against Germany's top side. ""We are not going to play 90 minutes of counter-pressing, but we're also not going to defend for 90 minutes, because we can't do that,"" he said. ""In Munich, you need to try and control the situation so that you don't get hit by their big right hook."" Stuttgart lost their opening five games of the season, but have shown a marked improvement of three wins, a draw and two defeats in their last six games. Bayern are the only team in Germany to have won all six home games so far this season. Their last loss at the Allianz Arena was against Stuttgart in March 2010. The key clash of the weekend sees second-placed Borussia Dortmund host fourth-placed Schalke in the Ruhr Valley derby. Borussia beat their rivals 3-0 the last time the teams met at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion in February when the hosts fired in 31 shots compared to Schalke's mere three -- a new league record low. Borussia Moenchengladbach go in search of their seventh successive Bundesliga win under caretaker head coach Andre Schubert when they host Ingolstadt 04 at Borussia Park on Saturday looking to make Bundesliga history. No coach has even won their first seven games in Germany's top flight -- even Bayern coach Pep Guardiola only managed to win his first three in 2013 -- and Schubert is poised to get the job full time after dragging Gladbach from bottom to fifth in the table."
56,01/11/2015,17:43,Own-goal helps Stuttgart escape bottom three,"VfB Stuttgart hauled themselves out of the bottom three on Sunday with a 2-0 win at home to Darmstadt, thanks primarily to an own goal.","Stuttgart climbed up from second from bottom to 14th with their third win in their last six league games after Darmstadt defender Gyoergy Garics headed the ball into his own net on 68 minutes. It was no more than hosts Stuttgart deserved, just moments after teenage striker Timo Werner had headed against the crossbar. Werner finally got on the scoresheet with the last kick of the game when he darted behind the defence and rounded the Darmstadt goalkeeper on 94 minutes. It was the first time in five away matches that mid-table Darmstadt have lost on the road. On Saturday, second-placed Borussia Dortmund cut the gap behind leaders Bayern Munich to five points as Marco Reus netted twice in a 3-1 win at Werder Bremen. Reus fired in the opening and third goals, but Borussia should have won by more as Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang squandered three clear chances. Right winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan capped a superb display with Dortmund's second having provided the final pass for both of Reus' goals. Wolfsburg climbed to third with a 2-1 win at home to fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen after Nicklas Bendtner scored the opener and Julian Draxler hit the winner. Ex-Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez equalised for Leverkusen just before the break, but the game was marred by two poor refereeing decisions from Manuel Grafe. The FIFA-listed ref missed a clear offside for Bendtner's goal, then failed to award a penalty when Wolfsburg's Daniel Caligiuri was fouled by Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno in the second half. Borussia Moenchengladbach earned their sixth straight victory to go fifth with a 4-1 win at Hertha Berlin having been bottom in September with five defeats. Gladbach's caretaker coach Andre Schubert earned his sixth straight league win since taking charge to level the record for a new Bundesliga coach. The result boosts Gladbach ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match at home to 2015 finalists Juventus while Hertha drop to sixth. Gladbach are now just two points behind Schalke, who needed a late Leroy Sane equaliser in their 1-1 draw at home to Ingolstadt after the Bavarian visitors took a shock first-half lead. Bochum-born Cameroon internationals Joel and Marvin Matip faced each other for the first time with Joel at centre-back for Schalke while Marvin captained Ingolstadt. Huub Stevens picked up a point in his first game as coach of Hoffenheim in their goalless draw at Cologne. Caretaker coach Stevens has been tasked with keeping second-from-bottom Hoffenheim up, with 28-year-old Julian Nagelsmann set to make history next season as the Bundesliga's youngest head coach. Japan's Yoshinori Muto claimed a hat-trick to rescue a dramatic point for mid-table Mainz in their 3-3 draw at bottom side Augsburg. Having given Mainz a 2-0 lead before Augsburg roared back with three goals, Muto scrambled the ball over the line for the 93rd-minute equaliser."
57,18/10/2015,19:40,"Controversial goals help Hanover, Stuttgart climb",Hanover and Stuttgart climbed out of the Bundesliga relegation zone on Sunday thanks to controversial goals.,"Hanover's revival continued as midfielder Leon Andreasen's winner sealed a 1-0 victory at Cologne, although replays showed there was a clear handball. After Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake fired in a cross, Andreasen steered the ball home at the far post on 38 minutes with the help of his upper arm, despite furious protests from the Cologne defence. ""I offered to lend my glasses to the linesman, but he didn't see it either,"" fumed Cologne coach Peter Stoeger after referee Bastian Dankert missed the handball. Hanover goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler pulled off a great save to deny Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste in the dying stages to rescue the win which left his team 14th in the table. Hanover are now unbeaten in their last three games, which followed five straight defeats, while Cologne drop to sixth in the table. Stuttgart shot up from 18th to 15th thanks to Daniel Didavi's second-half winner which sealed their 1-0 victory at home to Ingolstadt, but replays showed he was in an offside position. Stuttgart were without Serey Die for the last ten minutes after the Ivory Coast defensive midfielder was shown a second yellow card. Ingolstadt's Australia striker Mathew Leckie had his early penalty attempt saved by the feet of Stuttgart goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton. On Saturday, Bayern Munich became the first team to win their opening nine Bundesliga games as Thomas Mueller's first-half strike gave Pep Guardiola's side a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen. Mueller stole in front of Alejandro Galvez to control a Thiago Alcantara cross at the near post for his ninth of the season at the Weserstadion as Bayern made more Bundesliga history. Mueller's solitary strike condemned Bremen to a club record-equalling fifth consecutive league defeat. Bayern's 999th Bundesliga win sets them up for their trip to face Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday. It left the Bavarians seven points clear at the top of the table from nearest challengers Borussia Dortmund, who won 2-0 at Mainz on Friday. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel returned to face his former club in Mainz and saw Marco Reus put the visitors in front in the first half before Henrikh Mkhitaryan added a second. Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first career hat-trick as Wolfsburg climbed up to fourth with a dramatic 4-2 win at home to Hoffenheim at the Volkswagen Arena. Wolfsburg opened the scoring after just 41 seconds when Julian Draxler squared for Kruse to score his first goal since signing from Borussia Moenchengladbach in the summer. Schalke 04 are third, just a point behind their Ruhr rivals Dortmund, after Max Meyer struck a stoppage-time winner to see off Hertha Berlin 2-1. Benedikt Hoewedes had earlier headed the Royal Blues in front but Salomon Kalou's 73rd-minute header looked set to earn Hertha a share of the spoils. Gladbach continued their revival since Andre Schubert replaced Lucien Favre in the dugout as they romped to a 5-1 win away to Eintracht Frankfurt.

Hanover goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler pulled off a great save to deny Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste in the dying stages to rescue the win which left his team 14th in the table. Hanover are now unbeaten in their last three games, which followed five straight defeats, while Cologne drop to sixth in the table. On Saturday, Bayern Munich became the first team to win their opening nine games of a Bundesliga season as Thomas Mueller's first-half strike gave Pep Guardiola's side a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen. Mueller stole in front of Alejandro Galvez to control a Thiago Alcantara cross at the near post for his ninth of the season at the Weserstadion as Bayern made more Bundesliga history. Mueller's solitary strike condemned Bremen to a club record-equalling fifth consecutive league defeat. Bayern's 999th Bundesliga win sets them up for their trip to face Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday. It left the Bavarians seven points clear at the top of the table from nearest challengers Borussia Dortmund, who won 2-0 at Mainz on Friday. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel returned to face his former club in Mainz and saw Marco Reus put the visitors in front in the first half before Henrikh Mkhitaryan added a second. Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first career hat-trick as Wolfsburg climbed up to fourth with a dramatic 4-2 win at home to Hoffenheim at the Volkswagen Arena. Wolfsburg opened the scoring after just 41 seconds when Julian Draxler squared for Kruse to score his first goal since signing from Borussia Moenchengladbach in the summer. Schalke 04 are third, just a point behind their Ruhr rivals Dortmund, after Max Meyer struck a stoppage-time winner to see off Hertha Berlin 2-1. Benedikt Hoewedes had earlier headed the Royal Blues in front but Salomon Kalou's 73rd-minute header looked set to earn Hertha a share of the spoils. Gladbach continued their revival since Andre Schubert replaced Lucien Favre in the dugout as they romped to a 5-1 win away to Eintracht Frankfurt. Bayer Leverkusen were held to a 0-0 draw at Hamburg and promoted Darmstadt's good start to life in the top flight continued with a 2-0 victory at Augsburg. Sandro Wagner and Peter Niemeyer both netted in the first half as Darmstadt climbed into the top half of the table and left Augsburg, who are in this season's Europa League, second from bottom.

Hertha should have equalised before the break as striker Vedad Ibisevic headed onto the post, then fired over the bar. But they finally drew level on 82 minutes when substitute Alexander Baumjohann chested the ball through to Darida and the ex-Freiburg attacking midfielder slammed his shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. The point leaves Hertha sixth and Frankfurt 10th in the table. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting Darmstadt on Sunday evening, defending champions Bayern Munich took the chance to go five points clear on Saturday with a 3-0 win at Mainz as Robert Lewandowski's goal haul continued. The Poland hot-shot took his tally to 101 Bundesliga goals and has now scored 10 goals in just six league games this season. Having sent German league records tumbling last Tuesday with five goals in just nine minutes after coming the bench in the 5-1 rout of Wolfsburg, the 27-year-old claimed two more against Mainz before Bayern host Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Tuesday. Lewandowski marked his 100th Bundesliga goal by heading Kingsley Coman's cross inside the far post on 51 minutes and pulled up his shirt to reveal a T-Shirt which stated: ""100"". ""The T-Shirt was my idea, I didn't know if I'd score today, but you always have to think positively, which is why I had it made,"" he told reporters. An Arturo Vidal pass then put Lewandowski in behind the defence to round the goalkeeper for his 101st on 63 minutes. France Under-21 winger Coman grabbed Bayern's third five minutes later with a simple tap in from a Douglas Costa cross. Schalke remain third after Germany Under-21 attacking midfielder Leroy Sane scored for his third game in succession to seal Saturday's 1-0 win at Hamburg with a superb strike on the hour. Bayer Leverkusen, who play European champions Barcelona away on Tuesday, romped to a 3-0 win at Werder Bremen with goals by Swiss forward Admir Mehmedi, winger Kevin Kampl and Germany Under-21 talent Julian Brandt. Wolfsburg, who play Manchester United at Old Trafford on Wednesday in the Champions League, dropped more points in a 1-1 draw at home to bottom side Hanover to stay fourth. Bas Dost's header was cancelled out by Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake's superb volley on 57 minutes to leave Wolves fourth in the table. Borussia Moenchengladbach, who host Manchester City on Wednesday, picked up their second win since Lucien Favre's shock resignation last Sunday with a 3-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. The goals came from Granit Xhaka, a Christian Gentner own-goal and Raffel's late effort afer Daniel Ginczek slotted a 40th-minute penalty for Stuttgart. Hoffenheim climbed to 15th with a 3-1 win at Augsburg as Germany international Kevin Volland scored twice, including a second-half penalty."

Sane, whose father is ex-Senegal international Souleyman Sane, only made his Bundesliga debut in April 2014 and scored in Schalke's stunning 4-3 Champions League win at Real Madrid, last season, before bowing out of the last-16 on aggregate. The defeat is Stuttgart's fifth in succession to leave them 17th and they only stay off the bottom of the table by virtue of goal difference from Borussia Moenchengladbach. Borussia Dortmund have the chance to reclaim top spot on Sunday evening when they host Bayer Leverkusen looking to defend their unbeaten record after Bayern Munich took over first place after Saturday's 3-0 win at Darmstadt. Pep Guardiola's Bayern, who are bidding to become the first team to win the German league four times in succession, have won all five games so far this season. All three scorers -- Arturo Vidal, Kingsley Coman and Sebastian Rode -- claimed their first goals of the season with Munich's star forward Robert Lewandowski injured and Thomas Mueller on the bench. The result left Darmstadt in 12th place and still chasing their first win over Bayern after seven failed attempts. Gladbach's disastrous start to the season continued as they suffered their fifth straight defeat in losing 1-0 at neighbours Cologne in the Rhineland derby to stay bottom of the table. French striker Anthony Modeste claimed his seventh goal in all competitions, and his fourth in the Bundesliga this season, with a crisp header on 64 minutes. The victory left Cologne fifth while Gladbach, who lost their opening Champions League group stage match 3-0 at Seville on Tuesday, remain rooted to the foot of the table. Wolfsburg, who play at Bayern Munich on Tuesday, celebrated their 70th birthday with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin as Dutch striker Bas Dost netted twice and lifted his side up to third. After coming off the bench on 71 minutes, Dost netted the opener five minutes later, then drilled home a penalty on 89 minutes after a foul on Germany international Julian Draxler. But Dost was later slammed by his coach Dieter Hecking for behaving 'like someone had taken his toys away' in training having been subbed off in Wolfsburg's Champions League win at home to CSKA Moscow last Tuesday. Ingolstadt made history as the first Bundesliga team to win all three of their home games in their debut season in Germany's top flight after Moritz Hartmann drilled home a 93rd-minute penalty which put the Bavarians fifth with a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen. Bremen were reduced to ten men five minutes into injury time when midfielder Philipp Bargfrede was sent off for fouling Ingolstsadt's USA international Alfredo Morales. Hamburg were held to a goalless draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt while Mainz are seventh after Friday's 3-0 win at home to Hoffenheim when midfielder Yunus Malli claimed a hat-trick."
61,31/08/2015,18:45,Socceroo Kruse joins Langerak at Stuttgart,Australia winger Robbie Kruse will join Socceroos team-mate Mitchell Langerak at VfB Stuttgart this season after being loaned out for a year by Bayer Leverkusen on Monday.,"Kruse came off the bench for the second-half of Leverkusen's 3-0 German league defeat at Bayern Munich on Saturday, but it proved to be his final appearance in the Bayer shirt this season. The 26-year-old has had a tough three years at Leverkusen, where he has a contract until 2017, since his arrival from Fortuna Duesseldorf in 2013. He was restricted to just 21 Bundesliga appearances and two goals after tearing his cruciate knee ligament and then getting injured again at the start of the year. It is a brave move by Kruse with Stuttgart second from bottom of the table having narrowly avoided relegation last season, but increases his chances of first-team football after a frustrating period on the Leverkusen bench. Kruse will link up with Australian goalkeeper Langerak, who underwent surgery for a knee cyst last week and is expected to be out for up to eight weeks, joined Stuttgart from Borussia Dortmund in July."
62,23/08/2015,17:12,Dutt warns of 'greed consuming' Bundesliga,"Inflated transfer fees and salaries are a sign of the greed eating away at football, says VfB Stuttgart boss Robin Dutt, who on Sunday called for restriction measures in the Bundesliga.","Manchester City are reported to be poised to offer a club record of £50 million (69.9m euros, $78.1m) for Wolfsburg's Kevin de Bruyne in the latest big-money transfer affecting Germany's top flight. Their neighbours Manchester United have also been linked to a 100 million euros attempt to sign Bayern Munich's Thomas Mueller and Dutt says the current trend is hurting football in the home of the world champions. ""Greed is slowly eating away at our football,"" Stuttgart's director of sport Dutt told Sport1. ""It's no longer a game built on training and exercises in tactics, but has become a game of pure management. ""A young man, such as Kevin de Bruyne for example, is now surrounded by a bunch of people. ""He no longer knows what decisions he's making. ""We finally need a discussion about a cap for both transfer sums and salaries. At some point the bubble will burst."" Football is booming in Germany where the Bundesliga has the lowest ticket prices and the highest average attendances of Europe's five major leagues, but Dutt is not alone in voicing concerns about the esculating costs of transfers and salaries. The idea of a Bundesliga salary cap is not new and was last debated in 2009, when Schalke led the calls to introduce one, but received a mixed reception and little seems to have changed. Eintracht Frankfurt's Germany midfielder Stefan Reinartz, who won the last of his three caps in 2013, told German daily Bild last week that he is in favour of introducing measures so that ""salaries don't escalate"". But Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, one of his country's highest paid stars, says it would be ""difficult"" to introduce in Germany unless other leagues also had the same restrictions."
63,01/08/2015,19:17,City go down in Stuttgart in final friendly,"Manchester City were beaten 4-2 by VfB Stuttgart in Germany on Saturday in their final pre-season friendly, with only a late flourish sparked by Raheem Sterling rescuing some pride.","The Premier League club's manager Manuel Pellegrini sent out a strong starting line-up, featuring record signing Sterling and with Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and another new recruit, Fabian Delph, the only notable absentees. But Stuttgart, who only just avoided relegation from the top flight of the Bundesliga last season, found themselves 4-0 up inside 38 minutes at the Mercedes Benz Arena. Filip Kostic put them in front before Daniel Didavi scored a fine second and Daniel Ginczek added two more past a helpless Joe Hart in the City goal, to the delight of the home fans in the crowd of just over 40,000. There was an improvement from the English outfit in the second period, however, with Sterling setting up Nigerian teenager Kelechi Iheanacho to get a goal back six minutes from time. And Sterling was the provider again for substitute Edin Dzeko to make it 4-2 on what could be the Bosnian striker's last appearance for the club with a move to Roma on the cards. City, who had previously spent time in Australia and played a friendly in Vietnam this pre-season, begin their Premier League campaign against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns a week on Monday."

""I am aware that I need to work hard in pre-season so that I can play. ""When things get going again, we want to start our season well, then we'll see what's possible."" Stuttgart face Cologne in their opening match when the new season begins in August. He will be fighting with Poland international Przemyslaw Tyton and Germany Under-20 goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos for the Number One shirt at Stuttgart, who only narrowly avoided relegation last season to finish 14th in the table, while Dortmund were seventh. ""For goalkeepers, it is quit normal that they have to compete with one or two good rivals and we all have to fight for a regular place,"" said Langerak.

He will find himself competing for a first-team place with Poland's Przemyslaw Tyton after the departure of Sven Ulreich to Bayern Munich. Langerak joined Borussia in 2010 from Melbourne but never really held down a regular number one spot and had to be satisfied with an understudy role to Roman Weidenfeller. Although he made 17 appearances last season, the arrival of Swiss international Roman Burki from Freiburg seemed to have pushed him further down the pecking order."

Hector settled the tie with a superb individual goal after dribbling around four defenders on 78 minutes before Modeste scored Hoffenheim's second with a late header. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski scored twice as injury-hit leaders Bayern Munich romped to a 3-0 league win over Eintracht Frankfurt ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final at Porto. Bayern are now only three wins from claiming a third straight German league title.

After four months out with a knee injury, Ruediger, who has five caps for Germany, is ready to help resume his side's battle to stay in Germany's top flight. ""Good isn't enough. We need to run until there is nothing more left. We need to show some balls, we need the killer instinct,"" said the 22-year-old. ""We need more courage and more aggression."" Having been bottom of the table last December, Bremen are up to ninth and just four points from a European place for next season. Following a run of five straight wins up until mid February, Bremen's form has dipped in recent weeks with only six points from a possible 18 in their last six games. Bremen coach Viktor Skripnik lost four kilogrammes (eight pounds) in weight due to stress when they were in the relegation zone and the Ukrainian is more concerned about the ten points his side is from the drop zone, rather than dreaming about playing in Europe next season.

Dortmund bounced back from their 3-0 defeat at home to Juventus on Wednesday, which sealed a 5-1 aggregate defeat in the last 16, and two goalless draws in the Bundesliga as Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice to leave him with 12 goals in 25 league games. Dortmund took the lead in Hanover after Germany winger Marco Reus's no-look pass split the defence and allowed Aubameyang to bury his shot in the 19th minute. The lead lasted just 12 minutes as ex-Dortmund midfielder Leon Bittencourt stole possession on the halfway line, and sprinted to the edge of the area where he fed Lars Stindl whose weak shot beat the Borussia defence. Dortmund rode their luck when captain Mats Hummels headed off the line early in the second half from Spanish striker Joselu just before the hosts were reduced to ten men. Bittencourt was sent off on 55 minutes for a foul on Dortmund veteran Sebastian Kehl just six minutes after fouling Jakub Blaszczykowski. Dortmund made the numerical advantage count almost immediately as Reus again provided the final pass for Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa to score their second on 57 minutes for his first league goal since September. Kagawa then set up Aubameyang for his second goal with a cross which saw the Gabon forward head home on 61 minutes. Hanover set up a nervous last ten minute when Stindl beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller to make it 3-2 with 82 minutes gone, but the win leaves Borussia tenth with Hanover 14th. Bremen stay ninth after being held to a 1-1 draw at mid-table Cologne as a first-half goal by Germany Under-29 striker Davie Selke for the visitors was cancelled out by an 88th-minute penalty from Cologne midfielder Matthias Lehmann. Freiburg climbed out of the bottom three with a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks to second-half goals from Jonathan Schmid and Nils Petersen. Paderborn stay second-from-bottom after their goalless draw at home to ten-man Hoffenheim, who had Bosnia defender Ermin Bicakcic sent off for a second yellow card. VfB Stuttgart remain rooted to the foot of the table despite their 3-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. After Frankfurt midfielder Haris Seferovic gave his side a second-half lead Stuttgart striker Daniel Ginczek cancelled out the advantage by scoring twice in as many minutes. Romania midfielder Alexandru Maxim then added Stuttgart's third to seal their first home win since September. The result means just two points separate the bottom four teams of Stuttgart, Freiburg, Paderborn and Hamburg in Germany's top flight."

""Both of them will return at the end of the season, that's how things stand,"" Zorc told German magazine Sport Bild. Zorc also believes Dortmund are moving closer to extending the contract of Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, whose contract expires in June 2016. ""Let me put it in sober terms, I believe that both for him and us a contract extension would make sense,"" Zorc told German daily Bild. The club are hoping Gundogan will follow the lead of Germany team-mate Marco Reus who extended his Borussia stay until 2019 by signing a new deal last month. Dortmund are tenth in the Bundesliga and host Italian champions Juventus on Wednesday in the last 16 of the Champions League, looking to overturn a 2-1 defeat from the first leg in Turin last month."

""Doping has no place in sport, I completely disapprove of it, that is as true for me as a player as it still is today as the national coach,"" Loew told SID, an AFP subsidiary. Germany's head coach played in midfield for Freiburg from 1978-80, then again from 1982-84, while he spent the 1980/81 season at Stuttgart, whom he later coached. Having won the 1984 Bundesliga title, Stuttgart, who are currently bottom of the table, say they will co-operate with any investigation, but want a full copy of the commission's report to retrace the evidence. ""For us, it is hard to give out any information because we don't have any facts at hand and it happened well before our time,"" Stuttgart's director of sport Robin Dutt told Sky Sports. ""Nevertheless, we want to give a water-tight explanation, because we are interested in clean sport. ""In professional football, there is regular drugs testing and it appears there are no irregular findings. ""Therefore I strongly believe that in football we have a clean sport across the board."" Freiburg, who were in the second division during the period stipulated, say they will also support an investigation.

Former Bayern Munich and Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who played for Stuttgart from 1975-78, told broadcaster Sport1: ""I am totally surprised by these reports. I can't imagine that one of my teammates knowingly doped."" And Hans-Jurgen Sundermann, Stuttgart's coach from 1976-79 and 1980-82, told SID, an AFP subsidiary: ""That's absurd. I can't imagine that happening and can entirely rule it out."" Rainer Koch, chairman of the German Football Association'S (DFB) anti-doping commission, said he was concerned that they had not been informed beforehand. ""There have been serious allegations made which obviously must be completely cleared up,"" he said. ""It is strange however that the anti-doping commission has not previously been informed. ""The commission's findings are new to us and we have seen neither the results nor the report, therefore we can't comment.

Replacement striker Srdjan Lakic levelled just a minute after coming on and his 72nd-minute header was followed up when Alban Meha found the back of the net with a free-kick on 79 minutes. It was Paderborn's first win since the start of November and saw them climb from 17th before kick-off to 12th. Earlier, Freiburg had briefly escaped the bottom three with a 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin in Sunday's basement battle. The defeat dampened Pal Dardai's debut in charge of Hertha after the Hungarian national team coach took charge when Jos Lukukay was sacked earlier this month. But Paderborn's victory pushed Freiburg back to 16th and in the relegation places with Hertha second from bottom on a bumper weekend of goals in the German league. There were 38 goals in the German league's nine games as leaders Bayern Munich enjoyed an 8-0 rout of Hamburg while Wolfsburg won a 5-4 thriller at Bayer Leverkusen. On Saturday, Bayern claimed the biggest Bundesliga win for 30 years to warm up for Tuesday's Champions League clash at to Shakhtar Donetsk by hammering Hamburg in Munich. Stars Arjen Robben, Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze all netted twice as Bayern ran riot at Munich's Allianz Arena ahead of Tuesday's last-16, first-leg clash against Shakhtar in Lviv. This was Bayern's biggest league win since routing Kickers Offenbach 9-0 in March 1984 and it was the league's highest score since Borussia Moenchengladbach crushed Eintracht Braunschweig 10-0 in October the same year. It was Hamburg's heaviest ever league defeat. Just over two years after their 9-2 drubbing at Munich's Allianz Arena, Hamburg were again made to suffer having also been beaten 3-1, 5-0 and 6-0 on their last four visits to Bavaria. Second-placed Wolfsburg had Bas Dost to thank for their 5-4 win at Leverkusen as the towering Dutch striker claimed four goals while Bayer's Son Heung-Min scored a hat-trick, yet still lost. Having gone 3-0 up, Wolfsburg survived a spirited fight-back as Son claimed a hat-trick in just ten second-half minutes. Leverkusen finished with 10 men after Bosnia defender Emir Spahic was sent off late on for a second yellow card before Dost hit his fourth goal in the 93rd minute to secure a dramatic victory. The result leaves Wolfsburg both eight points ahead of third-placed Gladbach and as many behind leaders Bayern. Moenchengladbach claimed a 1-0 win at Cologne as Swiss midfielder c headed their 91st-minute winner. Two home fans were arrested after a 30-strong group invaded the pitch after the final whistle. Schalke 04 suffered a 1-0 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt in preparation for hosting holders Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg, tie. Frankfurt's Brazilian midfielder Lucas Piazon headed home from a corner with 65 minutes gone to leave his side ninth while Schalke dropped to fourth. Werder Bremen's remarkable run continues with a 3-2 win at Augsburg for their fifth straight victory which has taken them from 18th to eighth and the verge of a European place. VfB Stuttgart stayed bottom of the table after their 2-1 defeat at Hoffenheim, thanks to Sebastian Rudy's 93rd-minute winner. On Friday, Borussia Dortmund moved out of the relegation zone with a 4-2 home victory over Mainz as Germany winger Marco Reus got on the scoresheet, just days after committing to Dortmund until 2019."

After back-to-back defeats, the win lifts Freiburg up to 15th as they swap places with fellow strugglers Hertha, who drop to 16th and back amongst the bottom three.

74,06/02/2015,02:16,Guardiola shows strain as Bayern head to Stuttgart,Pep Guardiola is showing signs of feeling the pressure as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich hunt their first win of the year at strugglers VfB Stuttgart on Saturday.,"Bayern have failed to impress so far in 2015 in their two matches since returning from the Bundesliga's winter break with an 11-point lead. Their shock 4-1 thrashing at second-placed Wolfsburg last Friday was followed by a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke on Tuesday after playing for 70 minutes with ten men. The usually calm and composed Bayern coach sprinted 45 metres to remonstrate with the assistant referee after a Robert Lewandowski goal was disallowed in the 66th minute against Schalke. ""It was an emotional thing to do. I just spoke to him. It was very, very nice,"" said Guardiola tongue-in-cheek after the heated confrontation. But despite his brush-off remark, Guardiola needs an impressive display from Bayern to sooth any jarred nerves after the Wolfsburg defeat. Having steamrollered their domestic rivals before Christmas, Bayern were rattled in Wolfsburg and allowed Schalke to equalise, albeit with a numerical disadvantage following Jerome Boateng's dismissal. The Germany defender is banned for the next three games and misses the Stuttgart trip, plus home matches against Hamburg and away to Paderborn Stuttgart present the ideal chance to get back on track as Huub Stevens side are third from bottom after winning just one of their nine home games this season. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into the lead at the Allianz Arena before Schalke equalised and the Dutch star says they can ill afford similar performances as they bid for silverware. ""Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League,"" said the 31-year-old. Bayern have two league games before they face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Ukrainian city of Lviv in the Champions League last 16, first-leg clash. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg are set to give Andre Schuerrle his debut at home to Hoffenheim after signing the Germany winger from Chelsea on Monday to end his 19-month sojourn in London. Wolves needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to scrape a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday after their shock win over Bayern. China's Zhang Xizhe is waiting for his debut. Hertha Berlin are at Mainz 05 on Saturday with the capital city club second from bottom and with former player Pal Dardai and ex-assistant coach Rainer Widmayer now in charge. On Thursday, ex-coach Jos Luhukay became the fifth Bundesliga coach to be sacked this season after Wednesday's 1-0 loss at home to Bayer Leverkusen meant three defeats in three games. The Berlin club are battling to avoid their third relegation since 2010. Mainz will have striker Shinji Okazaki back in the side for the first time since his return from the Asian Cup where Japan reached the quarter-finals. Ahead of their trip to face Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund's coach Jurgen Klopp has insisted he will not resign with his side bottom of the table as they bid to avoid a first relegation since 1976. Dortmund will be without Kevin Grosskreutz at Freiburg and the Germany midfielder misses the next six weeks with a torn thigh muscle. He joins Ilkay Gundogan, Erik Durm and Lukasz Piszczek on Borussia's injury list. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04, who are sixth, have the chance to climb further up the table when they host third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. ""They are a direct competitor for a Champions League place and if we play as well as we did at Bayern, we will make Friday count,"" said Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
75,04/02/2015,12:40,Bayern target first win of 2015 at Stuttgart,Bayern Munich's stand-in captain Bastian Schweinsteiger says the Bundesliga leaders must raise their game at VfB Stuttgart on Saturday to secure their first league win of 2015.,"After Friday's shock 4-1 defeat at second-placed Wolfsburg, Bayern took a point despite playing for more than 70 minutes with ten men in Tuesday's 1-1 draw at home to Schalke, who are fourth. Arjen Robben's second-half header for the hosts was cancelled out by Benedikt Hoewedes at Bayern's Allianz Arena after Germany defender Jerome Boateng was sent off with just 17 minutes gone. Bayern hold an eight-point lead at the top of the table, but having taken just a single point from a possible six, Schweinsteiger wants both a win and convincing display at second-from-bottom Stuttgart. ""We need a win as well as a good performance in Stuttgart,"" said Schweinsteiger, Bayern's skipper in the absence of the injured Philipp Lahm. ""We played better than we did against Wolfsburg, we controlled the game more and didn't allow them to counter-attack, but we're not happy to have drawn with Schalke. ""Even with ten men, we still had chances to win the game."" Goal-scorer Robben says Bayern must improve if they want to challenge for this season's Champions League title as they prepare to face Shakhtar Donetsk away in a fortnight in their last 16, first-leg tie. ""We controlled the game with a man down, but the Schalke result is annoying,"" said the 31-year-old Robben. ""Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you go 1-0 up and then let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League."" Schalke face holders Real Madrid at home in their Champions League last-16, first-leg clash in a fortnight. Roberto di Matteo's side face a tough task having been routed 6-1 by the Spaniards at the same stage of the competition in Gelsenkirchen last season. ""We picked up a point in Munich and our plan worked well, but despite that we're a bit disappointed with the result,"" said Di Matteo. The ex-Chelsea boss was forced into giving teenager Timon Wellenreutehr his professional debut in the second-half after Schalke's two other goalkeepers were injured. Goal-scorer and captain Hoewedes said the Royal Blues need to beat third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday to stay on course for a place in next season's Champions League. ""We've made a good start to the second half of the season, but now it's all about Borussia Moenchengladbach at home,"" he said. ""This a direct competitor for a Champions League place and if we play as well as we did at Bayern, we will make Friday count."""
76,02/01/2015,14:00,Bayern tie up deal for rising star Kimmich,Bayern Munich have snatched rising German star Joseph Kimmich from under the noses of Bundesliga rivals VfB Stuttgart.,"Highly-rated defensive midfielder Kimmich, 19, a member of Germany's under-19 European championship-winning side, was due to leave RB Leipzig at the end of the season to return to his former club Stuttgart. But Bayern director of football Matthias Sammer and coach Pep Guardiola had singled Kimmich out as being high on their list of transfer priorities and the club moved in with an undisclosed offer to Stuttgart to allow the player to join the Bavarians instead on July 1 on a five-year contract."
77,25/11/2014,11:53,Bottom side Stuttgart turn to Stevens again,Dutch trainer Huub Stevens is back again at Bundesliga bottom side VfB Stuttgart after being named successor to Armin Veh as head coach on Tuesday.,"Veh was sacked on Monday after just six months in charge having claimed only nine points in 12 league games and Stevens is reported to have been given a contract by Stuttgart until the end of the season. The 60-year-old returns to Stuttgart after only six months away. After taking charge in May following the sacking of Thomas Schneider, Stevens kept VfB up last season as caretaker coach before resigning in May after taking 12 points from 10 games before Veh's appointment. Stevens, who has coached Schalke (twice), Hertha Berlin and Hamburg in Germany's top flight, will be on Stuttgart bench for Friday's Bundesliga match against fellow strugglers Freiburg."
78,01/11/2014,17:41,De Bruyne stars as Wolves climb to second,VfL Wolfsburg climbed to second in the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 4-0 hammering of VfB Stuttgart as ex-Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne tore the hosts' defence to shreds.,"De Bruyne netted his first goal of the season and created another two as Wolves picked up their sixth straight win in all competitions. The 23-year-old de Bruyne was in the thick of things, providing a free-kick for Robin Knoche to head Wolves into a 2-0 lead at the break after Croatia international Ivan Perisic's opening goal for the guests. Belgium's de Bruyne then scored his first goal of the season when he volleyed home from close range on 48 minutes before robbing Moritz Leitner of possession and providing Perisic with his second goal on 88 minutes. The victory leaves Wolves just a point behind leaders Bayern Munich who host Borussia Dortmund in the evening's key clash with 14 points separating the two teams. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund started the Allianz Arena match in the relegation places having dropped to 16th. A Rafael van der Vaart penalty sealed Hamburg's 1-0 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen which lifted the hosts out of the bottom three and dropped Dortmund into the relegation spots. Hamburg won a bad-tempered affair which saw nine yellow cards -- six were handed out in the first half alone -- after two separate scuffles broke out. Freiburg, who are at Cologne on Sunday, went bottom of the table after Werder Bremen moved up to 17th as caretaker coach Viktor Skripnikas got their first win of the season with ex-Chelsea and Wigan striker Franco di Santo netting both goals in a 2-1 victory ovber Mainz. Mainz took the lead when Japan's Shinji Okazaki scored his sixth league goal of the season to become the Bundesliga's joint top scorer. But Bremen hit back in their first match since Robin Dutt was sacked as di Santos headed home after his penalty attempt was blocked by Mainz goalkeeper Loris Karius just before the half-time break. The Argentina international then claimed his second of the game and sixth of the season when he netted a final pass from Felix Kroos, younger brother of Real Madrid's Germany international Toni Kroos. Hanover 96 went sixth in the table thanks to an own-goal from Eintracht Frankfurt defender Alexander Madlung just two minutes from time sealed a 1-0 victory. Borussia Moenchengladbach can reclaim second and equal the club's 40-year-old record of 17 games unbeaten when they host Hoffenheim, who have also yet to lose this season, on Sunday. On Friday, Roberto di Matteo picked up his third win in four matches as Schalke 04 coach as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored their first-half winner in a 1-0 victory at home to Augsburg. The result masked a poor performance from the Royal Blues who have moved up from 12th to seventh in the table since di Matteo took over from Jens Keller."
79,18/10/2014,16:40,Korea's Son bags brace for Bayer,South Korea's Son Heung-Min needed just nine minutes to score two Bundesliga goals on Saturday as Bayer Leverkusen ran riot in the first-half at VfB Stuttgart.,The 22-year-old striker scored from Leverkusen's first attack after just four minutes when he slotted home from 12 metres out after holding off Stuttgart defender Georg Niedermeier. Son added his second in spectacular fashion five minutes later when he collected a poor clearance from Thorsten Kirschbaum and rifled his shot past the stranded Stuttgart goalkeeper. He narrowly missed the chance for a hat-trick inside 11 minutes when his shot clipped the crossbar after he lobbed Kirschbaum. Leverkusen led 3-0 at the break as Germany's Karim Bellarabi made it 3-0 on 41 minutes when he fired home after a final pass from Son.
80,26/09/2014,09:27,Victory needed by both Schalke and Dortmund in derby,Bayern Munich are right where they want to be atop the Bundesliga after five rounds and ahead of a tough showdown against Cologne this weekend while Schalke and Borussia Dortmund both head into the 145th derby needing a victory.,"Munich head to Cologne on Saturday to face a team which had not conceded a goal in their first four games this season until Hanover scored in the midweek round of games. Bayern are happy about where they are, knowing that the weekend/midweek rhythm is just starting with a match-up against CSKA Moscow coming in the Champions League next week. ""I think we can be satisfied after the first five games. We've picked up 11 out of a possible 15 points, three wins and two draws - that's okay,"" said Munich board chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after the team's 4-0 victory over the previous surprise leaders SC Paderborn. ""Some people expected a bumpy start after the World Cup. We can be very satisfied with the season to date including the Champions League."" Bayern winger Arjen Robben said the win over Paderborn was important but the Cologne game matched that in their bid to stay atop the Bundesliga. ""It was really important for us to win and lay down a marker. That's what we're aiming for, where we want to be and - much more important - we want to stay there,"" said Robben. The top two challengers at the moment - Bayer Leverkusen and Hanover 96 - both have 10 points and play at teams who have not yet won this season in SC Freiburg and VfB Stuttgart respectively. Stuttgart sit second-to-last with two points after failing to hold a 2-0 lead at Dortmund in a 2-2 draw midweek. Stuttgart's troubles - they had scored just one goal going into the Dortmund match - resulted in the sacking of sporting director Fredi Bobic. ""In the end, we probably have to consider ourselves somewhat fortunate to be taking a point. With this performance, we have certainly taken a step in the right direction,"" said Daniel Didavi, who scored both goals against Dortmund. The Yellow-Blacks actually could have beaten Stuttgart but had a shot blocked at the line in stoppage time. In general, though, Dortmund know they cannot give up two goals every game. ""We need more stability in defence. We have already conceded nine goals in five matches which is not just a poor record, it is a very poor record,"" said captain Mats Hummels, who came on in the second half for his first action this season. ""We need to defend better as a team, and all eleven players have to play their part. If you concede two goals in each game, as has already happened four times this season, it's very hard to win."" And Dortmund need to win, having already dropped four points behind Bayern and three behind Leverkusen and Hanover. Schalke come into the match having finally won their first competitive match of the season - a 3-0 beating of Werder Bremen. The Royal Blues have won just one of the last four derbies at home against Dortmund. Manager Jens Keller knows his team will be well served to put together a string of victories to move back up the table. And Dortmund are a perfect opponent for that. ""We don't need to motivate the players for this match. It's the biggest derby in Germany. We are all excited for the match,"" said Keller, whose team has five points in 13th place.

81,13/09/2014,18:17,Ribery scores on return as Bayern go joint top,"Bayern Munich playmaker Franck Ribery scored in his first game this season as the champions moved joint top of the Bundesliga on Saturday, while Shinji Kagawa also enjoyed a goalscoring return as Borussia Dortmund saw off Freiburg.","Mario Goetze put the defending champions ahead in the first half before Ribery came off the bench to seal a routine 2-0 win over VfB Stuttgart at the Allianz Arena. Bayern are now equal on seven points with Bayer Leverkusen who were held 3-3 by Werder Bremen on Friday night and are ahead on goal difference after three games. The Bavarians scored the first goal of the afternoon after 27 minutes when Goetze drove a shot through a crowd of players when a free-kick was only partially cleared. In the second half Ribery, who has been suffering from a recurring knee injury, came on and the French midfielder secured the three points when he slotted under Sven Ullreich with five minutes left. The only down side for Bayern ahead of a Champions League clash with Manchester City in Munich on Wednesday was seeing defender Holger Badstuber hobble off with a thigh injury. Meanwhile, Kagawa made a dream start to his second spell at Borussia Dortmund after getting on the scoresheet in their 3-1 win over Freiburg at Signal Iduna Park. The Japanese midfielder returned to Dortmund from Manchester United last month and his clever pass for Kevin Grosskreutz helped the hosts open the scoring after 34 minutes. Grosskreutz's low cross was swept in by Adrian Ramos for his second goal of the campaign. The same three players were involved when Dortmund stretched their lead four minutes before half-time. This time Ramos found Kagawa, who sidefooted home in what was his 50th Bundesliga game. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a breakaway goal shortly after coming on before Oliver Sorg pulled one back for Freiburg. Dortmund are third on the Bundesliga table a point behind Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern. Elsewhere, Japanese striker Shinji Okazaki scored twice and Sami Allagui also found the net against the team he has just left as Mainz won 3-1 at Hertha Berlin. Okazaki gave the visitors the lead after 36 minutes, finishing on the rebound after home keeper Thomas Kraft twice denied South Korea midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol. Julian Schieber fired a great chance wide for Hertha before Allagui rounded off a lovely team move with twenty minutes left. It was the Tunisian attacker's first game for Mainz since rejoining them on loan from Hertha at the end of August. Ronny's late penalty gave Hertha hope but Okazaki's third league goal of the campaign ensured that Mainz got their first league win of the season. Hoffenheim had to settle for a point after Ivica Olic's deft finish drew visitors Wolfsburg level with a minute remaining. Anthony Modeste scored Hoffenheim's goal in the 1-1 draw, while Wolfsburg's Josuha Guilavogui was sent off late on. Promoted sides Paderborn and Cologne are both still unbeaten after they played out a goalless draw. On Friday, Bayer Leverkusen lost their 100 percent record when they were pegged back in a six-goal thriller against Werder Bremen. Werder's Sebastian Proedl made it 3-3 with only five minutes left as the visitors drew their third game in a row."
82,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."

""The Spaniard moved to Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2011 from Barcelona, and has so far made 33 Chelsea appearances. He spent last season on loan at Valencia."" Romeu, 22, has not played for Chelsea since suffering a serious knee injury in December 2012 that kept him out for the rest of the season, but he recently signed a new three-year contract with the club."
84,17/05/2014,03:04,Football: Time running out for Germany's Loew,Germany coach Joachim Loew can feel that time is running out for him to win a major title after eight years in charge of the much-feared national side.,"The 54-year-old, who hails from the Schwarzwald and still German accent, succeeded Jurgen Klinsmann as head coach after the 2006 World Cup. He has steered Germany to the semi-finals of the 2008 European Championship, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, but his resume lacks the major title which would elevate him to Germany's top division of coaches. Loew's image is a daily occurence in Germany where he fronts an advertising campaign for a leading cosmetics brand, but the head coach rarely appears in the media spotlight. The German Football Association (DFB) has already told him his job is safe beyond Brazil 2014 and Loew is expected to see out his current contract which expires after Euro 2016. But Loew has acknowledged that ""the clock is ticking"". Having never played senior international football, Loew made four appearances for West Germany's Under-21s and played Bundesliga football as a midfielder for Eintracht Frankfurt, Karlsruhe and VfB Stuttgart. He won the 1997 German Cup final as VfB Stuttgart coach and after working in Turkey and Austria, Loew joined the Germany set up as assistant coach in 2004. Loew was responsible for tactics with Klinsmann as the team's motivator and the pair delighted the nation as Germany finished third at the 2006 World Cup on home soil. His impressive record of 70 wins in 103 internationals, with a goal difference of 253 to just 98 conceded, has earned Loew plenty of respect in Germany. Under his stewardship, the Germans reached the Euro 2008 final and the semi-finals at both the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 by playing expansive, attack-minded football. He is not afraid of taking risks. When striker Mario Gomez struggled in the group stages of Euro 2008, Loew benched the forward and switched to a 4-2-3-1 system which resulted in a 3-1 quarter-final win over Portugal en route to the final. At the 2010 World Cup, Loew took the youngest German squad since 1934 to South Africa and his side came of age by sweeping aside both England and Argentina before losing their semi-final to eventual winners Spain. Even last week, Loew started eight debutants in the goalless friendly against Poland. Loew has issues to solve both in defence and attack before Brazil. His defence has looked frail on recent occasions, no more so than when Germany threw away a 4-0 lead against Sweden in a World Cup qualifier as they drew 4-4 in Berlin in October 2012. Only captain and right-back Philipp Lahm is sure of his place in defence and Loew needs strong performances from his back four in the remaining warm-up games against Cameroon and Armenia. There are also doubts about the attack. First-choice striker Miroslav Klose, 35, is injury prone and with Mario Gomez having been left out of Loew's extended provisional squad, 21-year-old Kevin Volland of Hoffenheim is the only other out-and-out striker in the squad."

""When you're shown a red card five minutes before the end of the match when you're 4-1 up, then you can call that 'brainless',"" fumed Rummenigge, who said Boateng will be fined a ""large five-figure sum"". ""Such a lack of discipline will not be accepted by Bayern Munich. ""In our jersey, you have to behave respectably and if you don't hear the message, then you have to feel it (in the wallet)."" Boateng's red card in the Bundesliga went down particularly badly just four days after Bayern's 4-0 drubbing at the hands of Real Madrid saw the holders crash out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage. His dismissal means the 25-year-old will be suspended for Bayern's final league match against VfB Stuttgart on Saturday when they will be presented with the Bundesliga trophy at Munich's Allianz Arena. Having won the German league title in March with a record seven games to spare, Bayern are still hoping to win the domestic double when they face rivals Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17 at Berlin's Olympic Stadium."
86,03/05/2014,19:56,Football: Bayern romp deepens Hamburg relegation fears,Mario Goetze netted twice in Bayern Munich's 4-1 win at Hamburg on Saturday which left the hosts facing a nerve-racking final weekend where they could be relegated for the first time.,"As the only team in Germany's top tier to have never been relegated, Hamburg's 20th defeat of the season left them third from bottom on 27 points. That's one point ahead of Nuremberg and two in front of Eintracht Braunschweig with those two sides occupying the automatic relegation places. The best former European champions Hamburg can now hope for is a two-legged relegation play-off against the third-placed side in the second division to preserve their top-flight status. Bayern bounced back from Tuesday's 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, second-leg to return to winning ways a fortnight before facing Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17. ""It wasn't easy after the Champions League defeat, but the win was important for us for the cup final in Berlin,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. ""I wish Hamburg the best of luck and hope they reach the play-offs. A club with their history belongs in the Bundesliga."" Bayern needed 32 minutes to take the lead as Goetze squared to Arjen Robben and then tapped home the return pass to put the champions 1-0 up. They doubled their lead when Goetze was left free to fire home Robben's corner on 55 minutes, which went in off colleague Thomas Mueller. Goetze grabbed his second when he slotted home Mueller's pass after Robben's shot was saved by Hamburg keeper Rene Adler. Hamburg pulled a goal back with 20 minutes left through Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu before Claudio Pizarro grabbed Bayern's fourth. Bayern defender Jerome Boateng was sent off just before the final whistle for striking Kerem Demirbay. The defeat means Hamburg cannot now finish outside the bottom three, the same fate befalling Nuremberg after their 2-0 defeat at home to Hanover 96. Bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, who lost 1-0 at home to Augsburg thanks to Raul Bobadilla's 94th-minute goal, were already certain of finishing in the bottom three in their first season back in Germany's top flight. As the bottom three are separated by just two points, all that remains to be decided in next weekend's final round of matches is which two go down and who goes into the play-off. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski enjoyed a 3-2 win against Hoffenheim in his final home match for second-placed Borussia Dortmund before joining Bayern next season. Hoffenheim took the lead after just five minutes when Brazilian forward Roberto Firmino beat both Germany defender Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer to drill home his shot. But Dortmund roared back with three goals in five minutes before the break. Germany winger Kevin Grosskreutz slotted in a 29th minute shot, Henrikh Mkhitaryan headed home two minutes later and then Lukasz Piszczek hit their third after a mix up in the Hoffenheim defence from a free-kick. A bad mistake by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who allowed a long-range shot from Niklas Suele to fly through his legs, made it 3-2 to the hosts with 66 minutes gone. Ten-man Schalke 04 need just one more point to secure a direct Champions League place next season after their 2-0 win at Freiburg kept them three points clear of Bayer Leverkusen in third as Dutchman Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his 59th league goal for the Royal Blues in his 100th Bundesliga game. Leverkusen kept their grip on fourth, and a Champions League play-off place, with a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. But both Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg can still claim the Bundesliga's fourth Champions League place next season. 'Gladbach's 3-1 win at home to Mainz keeps them sixth, three points from fourth, while Wolfsburg's 2-1 win at VfB Stuttgart, thanks to Ivica Olic's late goal, also keeps them in the hunt for a Champions League spot, a point below Leverkusen."

90,02/05/2014,02:25,Football: Real rout boosts Hamburg's hopes against Bayern,Rafael van der Vaart says Real Madrid's 4-0 drubbing of Bayern Munich in the Champions League will boost relegation-threatened Hamburg against the Bavarian giants in Saturday's Bundesliga clash.,"Hamburg, the only club in Germany's top flight to have never gone down, sit third from bottom in the table and at risk of an historic relegation. A thousand fans watched the team go through their paces on Thursday and shouts of ""never in the second division!"" echoed around the training ground. Hamburg are five points from safety with two games left and desperately need points against champions Bayern to climb out of the bottom three. If they finish 16th, they will face a last chance play-off against the third-placed side in the second division to try to maintain their Bundesliga place. But Bayern's Champions League exit in Tuesday's 4-0 semi-final, second-leg drubbing at home to Real has given Hamburg hope, says Netherlands star Van der Vaart. ""It's a matter of survival and honour for us. If we give our all, then we also have a chance against Bayern,"" said the 31-year-old, who is hoping to play after recovering from a calf injury. But the Dutch playmaker says Hamburg must be confident against Bayern. ""We need to show some balls, Bayern won't give anything away and it would be really bad for them to lose two games in a row,"" he said. Since being confirmed Bundesliga champions with a record seven games to spare at the end of last month, Bayern have produced some below-par performances which culminated in their drubbing at the hands of Real. ""After the defeat to Real, Bayern are sure to have no great desire to get on the plane to Hamburg. We want to annoy them,"" said director of sport Oliver Kreuzer in a radio interview. The Bavarian giants have wounded pride and will be looking to bounce back at Hamburg ahead of their German Cup final against arch rivals Borussia Dortmund in Berlin on May 17. ""We need to quickly lick our wounds so we put in a better performance in the Cup final against Dortmund,"" insisted chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Hamburg have suffered some heavy losses to Bayern recently, being routed 5-0 at home in February's German Cup quarter-finals and humbled 9-2 in Munich in the league in March 2013. Hamburg, for whom Mirko Slomka is their third coach this season after Thorsten Fink and Bert van Marwijk were both fired, are low on confidence after six defeats in their last ten games. Even Kreuzer has voiced doubts they will survive. ""There are legitimate doubts about a positive outcome. I have been waiting for weeks to see a reaction from the players,"" he fumed after Hamburg's lacklustre 3-1 defeat at home to mid-table Augsburg last Sunday, their third loss in a row. Hamburg have a few personnel worries with Germany pair Heiko Westermann, Marcell Jansen and Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu all struggling with injuries or illness. The top two places in the league are already decided with Bayern champions and Borussia Dortmund uncatchable in second. Schalke 04 are set to finish third, but the fight for fourth, which carries the final Champions League place for next season, rages on between Wolfsburg, who are at strugglers VfB Stuttgart, and Bayer Leverkusen, who are at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. At the other end of the table, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig are at home to Augsburg while Nuremberg, who are 17th, host Hanover 96 with both teams knowing defeat could see them automatically relegated."

""We want a Champions League place and we won't rest until we get it,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller.

Bayer enjoyed their second straight win since ex-Liverpool captain Sami Hyypia was sacked as coach, while Nuremberg suffered their fourth straight defeat which leaves them second from bottom. VfB Stuttgart took a big step towards survival with a 3-1 win at home to third-placed Schalke 04 which leaves them four points from the relegation places. Austria striker Martin Harnik netted twice while Germany forward Cacau also scored as Stuttgart raced into a 3-0 lead before Hungary's Adam Szalai pulled one back for the visitors with 20 minutes left. ""We've shown we can fight, keep things together and beat a team who are better than us on paper,"" said Stuttgart coach Huub Stevens. ""That's a step (away from relegation), but nothing more."" On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich ended a run of three Bundesliga games without victory with an unimpressive 2-0 win at bottom club Eintracht Braunschweig ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first-leg at Real Madrid. Peru veteran Claudio Pizarro, 35, and Croatian striker Mario Mandzukic were on target with late goals in what was only Bayern's third win in their last seven games in all competitions.

Borussia enjoyed a 4-2 victory at home to ten-man Mainz 05 as coach Jurgen Klopp faced his former side having coached them from 2001-08. Dortmund took the lead after just six minutes through a curious goal when Milos Jojic's strike went in off the upper arm of Borussia's Oliver Kirch, but despite furious protests the goal stood. Japan striker Shinji Okazaki scored twice for Mainz to make it 2-2, his second after pouncing on a terrible back pass from Dortmund's Nuri Sahin.

Wolves were reduced to ten men when Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off for a second yellow card on 90 minutes. Hamburg are facing an historic first relegation from Germany's top flight.

93,18/04/2014,02:20,Football: Bayern eager for Real Madrid confidence boost,Bayern Munich need a convincing win at Bundesliga bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Saturday to dismiss talk of a mini-crisis ahead of their Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid.,"With only two wins in their last six games, Bayern have suffered a dip since winning the Bundesliga nearly a month ago with a record seven games to spare. Bayern booked their place in next month's German Cup final with a 5-1 drubbing of second division Kaiserslautern in Wednesday's semi-final in Munich. But Munich's director of sport Matthias Sammer said while the scoreline was impressive, the performance was lacking spark. Bayern have lost back-to-back league matches, an obvious concern ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first leg at Real Madrid. ""I had the feeling that we're not really running hot at the moment,"" said Sammer, who questioned Bayern's desire to win the Champions League and German Cup finals. ""For the tasks we are facing, that's not enough. We have to ask ourselves if we still want to win these two titles."" On paper, Bayern's trip to Braunschweig looks straightforward, but the hosts have picked up seven points in their last four games to boost their survival bid. Braunschweig are without injured captain and striker Domi Kumbela, a rich source of goals for them in recent weeks, and are just three points from safety. Bayern will be without right-back Rafinha, who is serving a three-match ban after being sent off in last Saturday's 3-0 league defeat at home to Borussia Dortmund. There is also a question mark over Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer who missed the mid-week game with a calf strain. It remains to be seen whether coach Pep Guardiola rests his squad or looks for some continuity by naming a strong team four days before the trip to Real. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Mainz looking to pick up their fifth straight win having booked their German Cup final berth against Bayern on May 17. Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg in Tuesday's semi-final but both goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller (groin) and striker Robert Lewandowski (thigh) are carrying knocks. Lewandowski scored his 100th goal for Dortmund against Wolfsburg, but his final match in the black and yellow jersey will be against future employers Bayern in the cup final. Seventh-placed Mainz 05 now find themselves in a Europa League spot due to both cup finalists Dortmund and Bayern having qualified directly for next season's Champions League. A few shock results can be expected in the last four weeks of the season with sides desperate for points in the lower half of the table set to surprise those higher up. A good example is Saturday evening's tie when relegation-threatened Hamburg host VfL Wolfsburg, who are just a point off a Champions League berth for next season. Hamburg are the only team in Germany's top-flight to have never been relegated and have just four games left to escape the bottom three. Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka is without centre-back Heiko Westermann who has a groin injury. Wolves are without defensive midfielder Junior Malanda who tore knee ligaments in Tuesday's cup defeat at Dortmund. There will be a similar points battle when Nuremberg host Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday with the visitors eager to hold off Wolves and stay fourth. Second-from-bottom Nuremberg are two points from safety, but have lost their last three games. Likewise, Leverkusen have fragile confidence with only two wins in their last 13 matches despite their fourth place and fired coach Sami Hyypia a fortnight ago.

""My goal as coach is to help the team pick themselves up. We need an immediate reaction."" The Bundesliga champions suffered their heaviest home league defeat since 2008 on Saturday when their full-strength side was trounced 3-0 at home by second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who rested star striker Robert Lewandowski for the first hour. Bayern face Real Madrid in the Champions League's semi-finals later this month and are bidding to repeat last year's treble of European, league and cup titles. But the Bavarian giants are winless in their last three league games, including back-to-back defeats, since wrapping up the Bundesliga title with a record seven games to spare. ""We need to learn our lessons and talk a few things over. We get back to work on Monday with our focus on the future,"" said director of sport Matthias Sammer. ""We want to see the real Bayern Munich again. We need much better performances than against Dortmund."" Just three days after beating Manchester United 3-1 in Munich to reach the last four of the Champions League, Bayern were humbled at home as Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Marco Reus and Jonas Hofmann netted Dortmund's goals in the top-of-the-table clash. ""We were obviously hoping for a totally different performance in front of our own fans,"" said Bayern's Germany forward Thomas Mueller. ""A few things failed to gel and as a team, we weren't as fresh and hungry as we should be and want to be. ""There have been times this season when we've been in much better shape."" In the build-up, Bayern had insisted it was a meaningless match with the title decided and just bragging rights at stake, but the heavy defeat against Guardiola's first-choice side gave cause for concern. ""We were unable to maintain our concentration at 100 percent from the start against top-class opponents,"" said Sammer. ""We weren't focused enough in the decisive phases of the game. ""We rather handed it to Dortmund on a plate. ""The players aren't robots or machines. We're champions and the league is done and dusted, so it's not the end of the world."" To compound Bayern's problems, wing-back Rafinha was sent off late in the game for striking Mkhitaryan in the face. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer missed the second-half with a minor calf problem, but expects to play on Wednesday. ""We simply had a bad day at the office,"" said Neuer. ""I think we have different and more important challenges, but we can't just give up on the Bundesliga."" With four games left before Bayern are presented with the Bundesliga trophy on May 10 at home to VfB Stuttgart, Munich are at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Saturday."

Hanover were reduced to ten men when midfielder Andre Hoffmann was sent off on 62 minutes for a dangerous foul before Jan Hochscheidt scored the hosts' third just before the final whistle. ""That was an important three points and for our fans it's also an important emotional win,"" said Braunschweig's relieved coach Torsten Lieberknecht whose side face champions Bayern Munich in a fortnight. The result leaves Braunschweig unbeaten in their last three games and just two points from safety, while Hanover are two points from the relegation mire after four straight defeats. Later, mid-table Hoffenheim held Hertha Berlin to a 1-1 draw in the capital as Sami Allagui's early goal was cancelled out by Poland international's Eugen Polanski equaliser with half an hour gone. Hoffenheim's Germany hopeful Kevin Volland was only denied the winning goal on the final whistle when his free-kick was palmed over the bar by Hertha goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich suffered their first league defeat since October 2012 as their record 53-match unbeaten run was ended by a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Coach Pep Guardiola paid the price for naming a weakened team for the Bavarian derby with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League return leg at home to Manchester United. The Spaniard made seven changes from the side which drew 1-1 at Manchester United last Tuesday in the quarter-final first leg. Guardiola started with three teenagers in Augsburg, giving Bundesliga debuts to reserve team wing-backs Ylli Sallahi and Mitchell Weiser while Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg was named on the left wing. The gamble backfired when Weiser lost possession to Augsburg's Daniel Baier who fed Sascha Moelders and the  striker blasted his shot past Bayern's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with 31 minutes gone to claim the winning goal. This was only Bayern's third defeat of the season in all competitions having already been confirmed Bundesliga champions ten days ago with a record seven games to spare. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund earned a morale-boosting 2-1 win at home to VfL Wolfsburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, second-leg at home to Real Madrid. After Croatia's Ivica Olic gave Wolves an early lead, a Robert Lewandowski header put Dortmund level before Germany winger Marco Reus hit the 77th-minute winner. Borussia face a near-impossible task of overturning a 3-0 defeat from the first leg against Real to reach the Champions League's semi-finals. Schalke 04 are now three points adrift of Dortmund in third as they came from behind to claim a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart improved their chances of avoiding relegation with a 2-0 win at home to Freiburg to escape the bottom three with goals by Romania's Alexandru Maxim and Austria's Martin Harnik. Nuremberg drop to second from bottom after their 2-0 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, who moved up to fourth and into the Champions League places at the expense of Bayer Leverkusen. Leverkusen sacked coach Sami Hyypia on Saturday less than 24 hours after their 2-1 defeat at strugglers Hamburg which left them facing a battle to qualify for next season's Champions League. Hyypia, who took on his first senior coaching role last August, has been replaced by Sascha Lewandowski, the head coach of Leverkusen's junior side, who has five games to rescue their Champions League status."

Ribery, UEFA's best player in Europe last season, has not played for Bayern in more than a month after an operation on his buttocks, but made an appearance for France on Wednesday. ""I felt good, those few minutes against the Netherlands were good to get some match practice back. I'm ready,"" said Ribery after France enjoyed a 2-0 win over the Dutch. Bayern are looking to extend their record unbeaten league run to 49 matches and to claim their 11th consecutive victory. Fifth-placed Wolfsburg were hammered 6-2 at Hoffenheim last Sunday and Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer expects a backlash at the Volkswagen Arena. ""They suffered a setback in Hoffenheim and they will try and show a reaction, so we must have a few answers to that,"" said Sammer. With a 20-point lead, Bayern could even wrap up the Bundesliga title before the end of the month. Coach Pep Guardiola will want a convincing win before Tuesday's Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Arsenal with the hosts leading 2-0 from the first-leg in London. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund head to Freiburg on Sunday with a shortage of strikers. Poland's Robert Lewandowski sat out Wednesday's international against Scotland with a knee strain and Under-23 striker Marvin Ducksch is out for a fortnight with an ankle injury. It leaves Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp with only reserve striker Julian Schieber fit, but Germany winger Marco Reus could be switched to play up front. Bayer Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia is enduring the first crisis of his career after five straight defeats as they look for a first victory in seven years at Hanover 96 on Saturday. ""My coaching career has not been very long and this is the first time that I'm in such a situation,"" said the 40-year-old ex-Liverpool defender. ""Of course, I have spoken to many people to ask advice on what I could do. ""I want to develop myself and I wouldn't be learning so fast if we weren't in this situation."" Hyypia is hoping to have defensive midfielder Sven Bender back after a dead leg. Schalke 04 are looking to bounce back from successive horror defeats when they host Hoffenheim. The Royal Blues were drubbed 6-1 by Real Madrid in the Champions League, then crashed 5-1 at Bayern last Sunday in the Bundesliga. ""We have to look forward now and give the right response on the pitch against Hoffenheim,"" said coach Jens Keller. Peru winger Jefferson Farfan is doubtful with an inflamed knee while centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos is definitely out after being sent off in Munich. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart coach Thomas Schneider must avoid a ninth straight defeat when his side host bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Schneider came close to being dismissed after Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt and another loss would surely mean the 41-year-old being fired, despite having only taken charge in August. Schneider has the fans' backing as the Mercedes Benz Arena will be sold out for only the second time this season. Relegation-threatened Hamburg host Frankfurt desperate for three points to escape the bottom three. Playing Saturday (all times 1430 GMT unless specified) Schalke 04 v Hoffenheim, Bor.

124,02/03/2014,19:36,Football: Hoffenheim dent Wolfsburg's top four hopes,VfL Wolfsburg's hopes of breaking into the Bundesliga's top four suffered a setback on Sunday after being drubbed 6-2 at mid-table Hoffenheim.,"Wolfsburg finished the match with 10 men as German international Christian Traesch was sent off. Dieter Hecking's Wolves had hoped for three points in Hoffenheim to take fourth spot from Schalke 04, who were routed at runaway league leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday. Dutch striker Bas Dost had equalised for Wolves with 15 minutes gone after Roberto Firmino's fourth-minute strike gave Hoffenheim the lead, but the hosts responded with three goals. Hoffenheim led 4-1 at the break as defender Niklas Suele netted before French striker Anthony Modeste scored two goals in four minutes. Croatia forward Ivan Perisic pulled a goal back for Wolves with 15 minutes left. But the visitors had right-back Traesch sent off for a foul in the area and Hoffenheim's Sejad Salihovic netted the penalty before Modeste's replacement Sven Schipplock hit their sixth. Wolfsburg's result leaves them fifth. It means all three teams immediately behind leaders Bayern Munich and second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who beat Nuremberg 3-0 on Saturday, suffered defeats over the weekend. VfB Stuttgart are fourth from bottom after losing 2-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt in what was a club record eighth straight defeat and heaped further pressure on coach Thomas Schneider. Stuttgart striker Martin Harnik's first-half goal was cancelled out by Eintracht midfielder Jan Rosenthal ten minutes from time before captain Alexander Meier hit the 89th-minute winner. On Saturday, an Arjen Robben hat-trick saw Bayern open a 20-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win over ten-man Schalke 04. The Royal Blues suffered a second drubbing in four days after losing 6-1 to Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League clash. Bayern extended their record unbeaten league run to 48 matches, dating back to October 2012, and earned their 15th straight league victory. Bayern raced into a 4-0 lead inside half-an-hour as left-back David Alaba netted a free-kick, then Robben scored either side of Mario Mandzukic's header. Schalke were gifted a goal when Jefferson Farfan's corner was turned into his own net by Munich right-back Rafinha, in for captain Philipp Lahm, with 25 minutes left. To compound Schalke's misery, Greece centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a straight red for bringing down Mandzukic in the area. His foul allowed Robben to wrap up his hat-trick with a 77th-minute penalty. Coach Pep Guardiola flippantly told reporters ""don't ask me about the title"" in broken German on Friday, but with 11 league games left, Bayern can wrap up their 24th German league title by the end of March. Dortmund went second after their comfortable win over Nuremberg as Germany defender Mats Hummels netted on his return after four weeks out with a foot injury. Poland star Robert Lewandowski scored his 15th league goal of the season before Henrikh Mkhitaryan netted their third seven minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen's dreadful form continued with their fourth straight home defeat as they lost 1-0 at home to Mainz, who moved up to sixth with their fifth win in eight games. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting slammed home the winner past goalkeeper Bernd Leno on 37 minutes as Leverkusen suffered their eighth defeat in ten games to drop to third. Curiously, both goalkeepers scored own goals as Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are winless in their last eight games, were held to a 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig."

Their main domestic rivals did little to disprove Guardiola's point as Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke picked up just a point between them over the weekend. ""It took a while for the players to find their rhythm, but we played well after the first goal,"" said Guardiola. ""We had the opportunity to extend our lead and the boys took it."" The Bavarian giants extended their record unbeaten run to 47 Bundesliga matches, dating back to October 2012, to strengthen their iron grip on what will be their 24th German league title, baring a miracle. Having won last season's league title with a record six games to spare, Bayern are on course to break their own best mark. Hanover offered little resistance as Germany winger Thomas Mueller scored twice while attacking midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic also netted. There was more good news for both Bayern and Germany as Bastian Schweinsteiger made his first start since November after an ankle, then knee injury, to partner captain Philipp Lahm in the defensive midfield. ""It was good to start and have no problems, I feel good, even in terms of fitness,"" said Schweinsteiger. ""I still need to get into my rhythm and need some more match practice to get top fit. I just hope things stay positive for me."" Brazil's Rafinha, who took over from Lahm at right-back, strengthened his case for a Selecao place at June's World Cup with two crosses which both led to goals. Mueller set Bayern on the way to their 14th consecutive league win when he headed home Rafinha's cross with 25 minutes gone. Thiago then chested down Schweinsteiger's superb pass and fired home to make it 2-0 after 34 minutes. Mueller profited from a Mandzukic pass to get behind the Hanover defence and score his second on 59 minutes, while Mandzukic then headed home Rafinha's cross for Bayern's fourth, seven minutes later. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund suffered a shock 3-0 league defeat at strugglers Hamburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League last-16 clash at Zenit St Petersburg. Hamburg recorded their first league win since November in Mirko Slomka's first match in charge as his side broke their eight-match losing streak, including a club record seven league matches. The result sees Hamburg remain among the relegation places, but move up to 16th, while Dortmund stay third. There was more bad news for Jurgen Klopp on Sunday as defensive midfielder Sven Bender was ruled out for the next 10 weeks with an inflamed pelvis. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen went down 3-1 at VfL Wolfsburg as Sami Hyypia's side lost for the seventh time in their last nine games. Leverkusen suffered a Champions League hangover, following their 4-0 last-16, first-leg home defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, with another poor display. Braunschweig are now three points adrift at the bottom after their 2-1 defeat at ten-man Nuremberg in a match where three penalties were saved. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay sixth, but are winless in their last seven games after their 2-2 draw at home to Hoffenheim. Augsburg got back to winning ways with a 4-2 victory at Freiburg to bounce back from last weekend's defeat to Nuremberg, their only loss in the last eight games. VfB Stuttgart are just above the bottom three after they suffered their seventh straight defeat at home to Hertha Berlin, who ran out 2-1 winners. Hertha's replacement striker Sandro Wagner headed the winner, three minutes from time, but was then sent off for a second yellow card having only been on the pitch for 12 minutes. Fourth-placed Schalke, who host Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League last-16, first-leg clash, stayed fourth after their goalless draw at home to Mainz 05 on Friday."

Striker Domi Kumbela scored his fourth goal in two games when he put Braunschweig ahead on 34 minutes, but then had his penalty attempt saved by Schaefer. Hosts Nuremberg equalised, then went ahead in the two minutes after the break as first Kiyotake, then Tomas Pekhart netted. Nuremberg's goalkeeper Schaefer then saved Braunschweig defender Ermin Bicakcic's penalty attempt, before Kiyotake squandered the chance to put his side 3-1 up. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay sixth after their 2-2 draw at home to Hoffenheim while Augsburg got back to winning ways with a 4-2 victory at Freiburg to bounce back from last weekend's defeat to Nuremberg, their only loss in the last eight games. VfB Stuttgart are just above the bottom three after they suffered their seventh straight defeat at home to Hertha Berlin, who ran out 2-1 winners. Hertha's replacement striker Sandro Wagner headed the winner, three minutes from time, but was then sent off for a second yellow card having only been on the pitch for 12 minutes. Fourth-placed Schalke, who host Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg clash, stayed fourth after their goalless draw at home to Mainz 05 on Friday. European champions Bayern Munich are at Hanover 96 on Sunday evening looking to build on their commanding 16-point lead and extend their record 46-match unbeaten league run."

The Royal Blues put on a regal performance at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena with Jefferson Farfan tapping home after a superb run from defender Sead Kolasinac on 39 minutes. Teenage wunderkind Max Meyer added a second a minute before the break. ""That was a very good performance we put in,"" enthused Schalke coach Jens Keller, who said defender Atsuto Uchida picked up a leg injury and midfielder Roman Neustadter had a badly cut knee. The defeat ended Hanover's recent form having won their first two games of the year under new coach Tayfun Korkut to leave the guests lying tenth. Earlier, ten-man VfB Stuttgart dropped closer to the Bundesliga's relegation battle after suffering their fifth-straight defeat in a 4-1 rout at home to buoyant Augsburg. ""There's no need to discuss the performance,"" fumed Stuttgart coach Thomas Schneider. ""Their victory was deserved and I am very, very disappointed, we must apologise to the fans as we gifted the three points in a ten-minute spell. Bavarian minnows Augsburg are dreaming of international football next season as they rose to eighth after a sixth consecutive game unbeaten.

The defeat leaves Stuttgart 14th in the table, only two places from the relegation zone. Hamburg are also deep in the relegation mire after they were thrashed 3-0 at home to Hertha Berlin on Saturday night to set an unwelcome club record of six straight defeats.

""They showed from the start who was the boss,"" enthused ex-Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer. ""At the break they could have been three of four-nil ahead.""

Likewise, Robben came off the bench and fired home Goetze's final pass to put his leg injury behind him on 67 minutes before Dante headed Bayern's fourth two minutes later. Fittingly, Mandzukic, who was dropped ten days ago for poor training performances, netted their fifth on 89 minutes and was mobbed by his team-mates.

But despite their status as overwhelming favourites to retain the title this season, Guardiola says they cannot afford to take their eye off the ball, particularly following Wednesday's last-minute 2-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. ""If a team doesn't lose 43 times and everyone says that the Bundesliga (title-race) is over, with the championship is secured, it's not easy for the player's to stay focused,"" said Guardiola. ""To always win, win, win -- I know how difficult that is."" The victory gave Bayern yet another league record as they went 28 away matches unbeaten, breaking Hamburg's previous mark of 27 set in 1983. Last season they broke or equalled 25 Bundesliga records, winning the title with a record six games to spare, as they finished up with a 25-point margin. Stuttgart came the closest of any team to beating Bayern in the league this season until Thiago Alcantara's last-minute bicycle kick broke their resistence.

143,31/01/2014,02:30,Football: Who can stop break Bayern Munich's record run?,They may have a 13-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga and be on a 43-match unbeaten run but Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola has warned his team to stay focussed.,"The Bavarian giants host Eintracht Frankfurt at Munich's Allianz Arena on Sunday with wingers Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben both back in contention after leg injuries. But despite their status as overwhelming favourites to retain the title this season, Guardiola says they cannot afford to take their eye off the ball, particularly following Wednesday's last-minute 2-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. ""If a team doesn't lose 43 times and everyone says that the Bundesliga (title-race) is over, with the championship is secured, it's not easy for the player's to stay focused,"" said Guardiola. ""To always win, win, win -- I know how difficult that is."" The victory gave Bayern yet another league record as they went 28 away matches unbeaten, breaking Hamburg's previous mark of 27 set in 1983. Last season they broke or equalled 25 Bundesliga records, winning the title with a record six games to spare, as they finished up with a 25-point margin. Stuttgart came the closest of any team to beating Bayern in the league this season until Thiago Alcantara's last-minute bicycle kick broke their resistence. That was enough to see the rest of the league as good as throw in the towel as far as the Bundesliga is concerned. Guardiola has not even had his entire squad available so far this season with Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger the main star currently sidelined with a knee injury.

144,28/01/2014,02:15,Football: No place for egos in Bayern's title march,Captain Philipp Lahm has said there is no room for egos in Bayern Munich's squad as they bid to go 13 points clear in the Bundesliga at Stuttgart on Wednesday.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern take on strugglers VfB Stuttgart in a re-arranged league fixture looking to extend their record unbeaten run to 43 matches. Guardiola clamped down on any complacency by dropping top-scorer Mario Mandzukic for Friday's 2-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach for poor performances in training. Lahm has said Bayern's star-studded squad can expect a few more tough-luck stories to come in the following weeks in their quest for a 24th league title. ""We have an enormous squad and when everyone is fit, there will be more hard-luck cases for those not involved,"" said Lahm. ""I don't judge the other players. ""The coach chooses the team, we have to accept that and stand behind his decision."" One of the stars who will definitely not feature at 12th-placed Stuttgart is Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger who has an inflamed knee ligament. The 29-year-old had surgery for an ankle injury late last year, but aggravated a knee ligament in the winter training camp in Doha. Bayern insist there is no risk of Schweinsteiger missing June's World Cup in Brazil, but Guardiola wants his midfield general back as soon as possible. ""This is a problem for us and for him. We need him and so does the national team. I hope he will be back as soon as possible,"" said Guardiola. Having last lost in the Bundesliga in October 2012, it would be a major shock if Bayern stumble in Stuttgart. Stuttgart coach Thomas Schneider insists ""it's a bonus game"", while captain Christian Gentner sees it as ""probably our easiest match"", so low are the expectations on the hosts. ""Perhaps it's better if we don't look at the table at the moment and concentrate on the game,"" said attacking midfielder Alexandru Maxim referring to the 28 points that separate Bayern Munich and Stuttgart. With five defeats in their last seven games, Stuttgart are looking to bounce back from consecutive defeats and try and sew some doubt in the Bayern players minds over the ultimate destination of the title. However, Bayern's three main rivals need all the help they can get from other teams, as they hardly helped their cause in collectively picking up a combined total of just one league point over the weekend. Guardiola's side by contrast is showing no sign of dropping points. They are on course to break their own record last season for the earliest title win when they were confirmed champions in April with six games to spare. ""This is a huge opportunity to extend our lead,"" said Lahm. ""Then it would be hard to catch us. We wouldn't be against winning the championship title early."""
145,26/01/2014,17:20,Football: Mandzukic becomes a casualty of Bayern's perfectionism,"Bayern Munich can go 13 points clear in the Bundesliga with a win at VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday, but the treatment of top-scorer Mario Mandzukic highlights their dedication to perfection.","Pep Guardiola's Bayern can further tighten their grip on a 24th German title at Stuttgart and are unbeaten in 27 away matches in the Bundesliga. The title is theirs to lose after the four teams chasing them in the league earned a total of just one point over the weekend. But Mandzukic found himself superfluous to requirements in Friday's 2-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach -- even as top scorer with ten goals this season. The Croatian striker was a key factor in Bayern winning the treble of European, league and cup titles last season, but reputations count for little under Guardiola. Mandzukic was barely missed in Gladbach as Bayern picked up their 15th win from 17 league matches to extend their record unbeaten run to 42 Bundesliga matches ""He hasn't been training as we know he can, he needs to step on the gas again,"" explained Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer. In his absence, namesake Mario Goetze was moved up from midfield as the lone striker and scored Bayern's first goal in an impressive display. Guardiola opted to take a trio of untested teenagers Ylli Sallahi, Mitchell Weiser and Pierre Emile Hojbjerg to Gladbach instead of Mandzukic. The Croatia star took his frustrations out on the ball with six goals in Saturday's training match back in Munich. No doubt the news Poland striker Robert Lewandowski will be joining Bayern next season has hardly gone down well with Mandzukic. Sammer insisted it was neither a factor in him being left out of the match squad at Gladbach, nor are Bayern considering selling him. ""I didn't get the impression that it has something to do with it,"" he said. ""Everything else, which would be speculated, is wrong. ""We need him and we're happy to have him."" Germany winger Thomas Mueller said the players know they must give only their best performances -- whether in training or in matches -- under Guardiola's stewardship. ""You have to see for yourself that you have to always give your best for the team,"" said Mueller, who netted Bayern's second-half penalty in Gladbach. ""If you do that, you'll have no troubles. ""The coach will have his reasons for the team he chooses."" Mandzukic's treatment might just be a psychological trick to motivate a seasoned performer. ""The heart is more important than anything else, if it's missing then you sometimes have to give it a nudge to start again,"" said Sammer. It remains to be seen whether Mandzukic returns for the game with Stuttgart, who are down to 12th in the table after Saturday's 2-1 defeat at home to Mainz. France winger Franck Ribery is expected to return from a leg knock and said Bayern want three more points from the re-arranged match to further dispirit their rivals."

But Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen were stunned at Freiburg as the hosts twice came from behind before midfielder Felix Klaus hit the dramatic 90th-minute winner. ""We were okay in the first-half, then we gave away too much ball and Freiburg counter-attacked us,"" admitted Hyypia. ""They were dangerous, we tried to win the game, but then came the final counter attack."" The result saw Freiburg climb out of the bottom three up to 15th as the hosts cancelled out goals by Bayer midfielders Lars Bender and Simon Rolfes. Leverkusen have lost their last three games after finishing 2013 with league defeats to strugglers Frankfurt and Bremen. Bayern can extend their lead even further with a trip to VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a re-arranged fixture. Borussia Dortmund clawed their way up to third place on goal difference over Moenchengladbach with a 2-2 draw at home to Augsburg with Lars's twin brother Germany midfielder Sven Bender netting for both sides. The Dortmund midfielder gave the hosts the lead at Westfalenstadion after just six minutes, then turned the ball into his own net on 56 minutes for Augsburg's equaliser. Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin looked to have spared Bender and Borussia's blushes with a brilliant free-kick to make it 2-1 with 20 minutes left. But Augsburg drew level when South Korea's Ji Dong-Won -- who will play for Dortmund next season -- headed home just two minutes after coming on to leave his side ninth in the table. ""There was too much tension in our play, the joy of playing in a wonderful game like this was hardly to be seen,"" mused Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""We got more tense as the game wore on and our game didn't improve, it just got more and more loose."" The point looks to have come at a cost as Poland Jakub Blaszczykowski winger is thought to have torn his cruciate knee ligament. Should the injury be confirmed, he will be the second Dortmund star sidelined with a long-term knee injury after centre-back Neven Subotic suffered the same injury in November. ""We have only bad news,"" said Klopp. ""For us this is a disaster, but mainly it's terrible for Kuba (Blaszczykowski)."" Borussia picked up their first point at home after three consecutive defeats in Dortmund, and have taken just five points from their last seven league games. They are now 14 points behind Bayern while fifth-placed VfL Wolfsburg also lost ground as they suffered a 3-1 defeat at home to Hanover 96. New coach Tayfun Korkut celebrated his first game in charge with Hanover's first away win of the season after eight straight defeats. The result put a dampener on Kevin de Bruyne's debut after the Belgium midfielder became Wolfsburg's record signing last weekend when he moved from Chelsea. Hanover took the lead through striker Artjoms Rudnevs, which was cancelled out by Croatia striker Ivica Olic's first half tap-in. A pair of second-half goals by ex-Dortmund midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt sealed the welcome win for Hanover. Nuremberg also celebrated a milestone as they became the last team in a major European league to pick up their first win of the season with a 4-0 victory over Hoffenheim. Likewise, Eintracht Frankfurt picked up their first home win of the season with a shock 1-0 win to move up to 14th against sixth-placed Hertha Berlin.

Guardiola sprang a surprise before kick-off at Borussia Park as striker Mario Mandzukic was left out of the squad for ""poor performances in training"" with midfielder Goetze starting up front. ""Mario hasn't trained like he normally does,"" explained Bayern's director of sport, Matthias Sammer.

A superb long ball down the right flank from wing-back Rafinha found Mueller, who then flicked his cross to Goetze to fire home with barely seven minutes played. Moenchengladbach barely got a look in until the closing stages of the first-half. First Germany striker Max Kruse snapped up a throw-in, turned Bayern's Dante inside-out before unleashing a fierce shot which beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, but thundered off the post. On the stroke of half-time, Juan Arango forced Neuer into a good save as the hosts finally found their form. Munich put the result beyond doubt after a goalmouth scramble as Goetze had a shot blocked, only for the ball to clip Gladbach midfielder Granit Xhaka on the arm and referee Peter Gagelmann signalled for a penalty. Mueller rifled home the spot-kick on 54 minutes to double their lead, while Gladbach could only waste the few chances which came their way. Midfielder Patrick Herrmann fired wide on 66 minutes from almost the identical situation for the Goezte goal, which summed up the hosts' night as they suffered their first home defeat of the season. Bayern can yet extend their lead even further with a trip to VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a re-arranged fixture before hosting Eintracht Frankfurt next Sunday."

154,24/01/2014,14:28,Football: Bayern's Ribery eyes Champions League history,France winger Franck Ribery has said Bayern Munich aim to become the first team to defend the Champions League title and is backing the Bavarian giants to win another treble.,"No side has ever retained the Champions League title since the competition replaced the European Cup format in 1992. Bayern became Germany's first team to scoop the treble of Champions League, German Cup and Bundesliga titles last season. Having drawn Arsenal in the last 16 of this season's Champions League, Ribery has said Pep Guardiola's side can lift the title again in the May 24 final at Lisbon's Estadui da Luz, home of Benfica. The Bundesliga resumes after a four-week winter break on Friday with third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach hosting leaders Bayern, who are seven points clear at the top of the table. Bayern finished 2013 with five titles, adding the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup to their treble, but Ribery says they face a challenge to do it all again this year. ""We want to have just as successful a year as 2013 despite the fact that it will definitely be harder,"" Ribery told Bundesliga.com. ""I believe it's possible though. ""We have an incredible amount of untapped potential at FC Bayern. ""We're capable of retaining our status as German champions, but also of winning the German Cup and becoming the first-ever team to defend our Champions League title. ""We want to continue winning everything and create even more history."" Bayern are on a record 41-match unbeaten run, dating back to October 2012, and Ribery said they want to finish the current season unbeaten. ""My aim is to become German champions without suffering a single defeat,"" said the 30-year-old. Bayern also travel to VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday for a re-arranged fixture and play three league games in ten days. ""We've got two difficult games ahead of us, including next Wednesday's clash with VfB Stuttgart,"" said Ribery. ""We're determined to win both games to enjoy a positive start to the new year and to send out a message."""

The Bavarian giants face three league games in ten days as they tackle VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a postponed fixture, then host Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday February 2. The aim for the Bavarians now is to produce another eye-catching performance to dispirit the chasing pack. ""We must show the competition that there is nothing to pick up in terms of points,"" said Germany forward Thomas Mueller. ""We mustn't show any weak points and give rise to any hope. ""We can't go half-hearted into these games, the supposedly mighty FC Bayern won't be given any favours."" Bayern's thirst for titles is unsatiable at present having added the Club World Cup in December to August's UEFA Super Cup title after last season's treble of European, league and domestic cup titles. But Pep Guardiola's team were given a wake-up call in a friendly last Saturday when hosts Red Bull Salzburg inflicted a 3-0 defeat on Bayern, which set off a few ""alarm bells"", according to Mueller. ""We need to get out of holiday mode,"" said the 24-year-old as the Bundesliga returns after a four-week break. ""Gladbach will want to take something out of this. ""If an opponent is aggressive and doesn't crap their pants, then we can also have a few problems to deal with."" Gladbach usurped Borussia Dortmund from third place in the league with a strong finish to 2013. Borussia Park has uncomfortable memories for Bayern who lost 3-1 there in January 2012, having also gone to Gladbach as league leaders, and they had to fight back from 3-1 down in May before sealing a 4-3 win. ""It will be a hotly-contested game, if we aren't focused, there will be a result like there was in Salzburg,"" said Bayern's ex-Gladbach defender Dante. Dortmund, who are down to fourth place, need to break a three-match losing streak in the league at home when they host Augsburg on Saturday. Bayern, Leverkusen and Hertha Berlin all enjoyed wins at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion towards the end of the year and coach Jurgen Klopp's side enjoyed a 6-1 friendly drubbing of minnows Duisburg on Tuesday. Klopp will still be without the injured trio of midfielder Ilkay Gundogan (back), plus defenders Mats Hummels (ankle) and Neven Subotic (knee). Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen will also want to bounce back from their 1-0 defeat at Werder Bremen in December when they travel to face third-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday."

164,01/12/2013,11:02,Football: Schalke hand teenage star Meyer five-year deal,Bundesliga side Schalke 04 have given 18-year-old rising star Max Meyer a five-year extension to keep the attacking midfielder at the Royal Blues until 2018.,"The Germany Under-19 talent, who reached the European Under-17 championships final with his country in 2012, has scored three goals in 10 Bundesliga games this season and is tipped as a future star. He came on for the final 15 minutes of Schalke's 3-0 win at home to VfB Stuttgart on Saturday to go fifth in the league. ""It is excellent news for the club,"" said Schalke general manager Horst Heldt. ""Many professionals in the game have predicted a great career in football for him. ""His development in the past few months has been almost breathtaking."" Meyer joined the Schalke youth team from Duisburg in 2009 and in 2011-12 won the German Under-19 championships with the Royal Blues after beating Bayern Munich in the final. The teenager is in the Schalke squad for the Champions League with the hosts needing to beat Swiss champions FC Basel in a fortnight to reach the last 16."
165,30/11/2013,20:30,Football: Robben strikes as Bayern extend record,Bayern Munich extended their unbeaten Bundesliga record to 39 games with a workmanlike 2-0 home win over bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Saturday with Arjen Robben scoring both goals.,"Having set a new Champions League record of ten consecutive victories with their 3-1 win at CSKA Moscow on Wednesday, Bayern again cruised to victory in Munich. ""It was a complicated and difficult game against a defence-minded opponent,"" said Bayern boss Pep Guardiola, who with 12 wins and two draws, has extended his record for the best start by a new Bundesliga coach. ""We dominated possession and, in the first half, we were very strong mentally after (last Saturday's 3-0 win at) Dortmund and the trip to Moscow. ""In the second half we didn't manage to bring (striker) Mario Mandzukic into the game, but it is one game more and at the end, I am happy with the performance."" Even with hamstring-victim Philipp Lahm, plus France's Franck Ribery and Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger on the walking wounded list, Bayern had too much fire-power for Braunschweig. Having warned his side not to underestimate Eintracht, who have never won in Munich, Dutch winger Robben was as good as his word. The Netherlands star put the hosts ahead with a header after just two minutes, then slammed home a 30th-minute shot, but this was not an impressive performance as Bayern barely got out of second gear. Borussia Dortmund picked up their first win in three league games with a hard-fought 3-1 win at ten-man Mainz 05 to stay third and seven points behind Bayern. Dortmund took the lead on 70 minutes when Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired home a superb free-kick, but the lead lasted just four minutes before Cameroon's Eric Choupo-Moting fired home a penalty. Mainz were reduced to 10 men when Colombia's Elkin Soto was sent off for stopping the ball going into the net with his hand and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski fired home the 79th-minute penalty. Lewandowski then made sure of the points with his second penalty when he converted the 94th-minute spot kick when left-back Erik Durm was up-ended. ""You have to evaluate the win in the context of our situation,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who lost his entire back four ten days ago through injury. ""There was a very, very good fighting spirit. ""The fact that in certain situations our opponents had their chances to win the game says everything about Mainz's class."" Bayer Leverkusen bounced back from their 5-0 drubbing at home to Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday -- their worst home result in Europe -- with a 3-0 win at home to Nuremberg to stay second. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min netted twice while Germany's Stefan Kiessling hit their second after a superb back-heel from midfielder Jens Hegeler. Schalke, who have lost left-back Dennis Aogo for the rest of the season with a knee injury, moved up to fifth with a 3-0 win at home to VfB Stuttgart. Peru winger Jefferson Farfan scored twice, including a penalty early in the second-half, before US midfielder Jermaine Jones added a late third. Mid-table Werder Bremen warmed up for next Saturday's visit of Bayern with a point at Hoffenheim in an eight-goal thriller as sub Philipp Bargfrede -- with the Bremen squad number 44 -- equalised in the 91st-minute to make it 4-4. Augsburg -- who face holders Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the third round of the German Cup -- warmed up with a goalless draw in the capital against Hertha Berlin.

The Royal Blues, third in Group E, must beat Swiss champions FC Basel in Gelenkirchen in a fortnight  to progress to the knock-out stages of the Champions League. Aogo is the third Schalke player to suffer a serious knee injury with midfielder Marco Hoeger also out for the season while striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar is expected to return early in the new year after knee surgery. It ends an unhappy season for Aogo, who was sent on loan from Hamburg after taking an unapproved trip to Mallorca after a heavy defeat in August. He has now seen his chances of forcing his way back into the Germany team ahead of the 2014 Brazil World Cup effectively ended, having made made the last of his 12 appearances in June. Schalke's Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng has also been bothered by a knee problem having flown home from Romania, missing his team's midweek goalless draw at Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League, to seek treatement for a knee injury. Schalke, who are sixth in the Bundesliga, host VfB Stuttgart on Saturday and hope to have rising Germany star Julian Draxler and Boateng in the starting line-up."

But Bert van Marwijk's Hamburg brushed off the loss of their skipper to claim their first home win in six attempts. ""It was a hard-fought victory for us with both teams under pressure. Hanover are going through a difficult time while we needed to finally win at home,"" said Van Marwijk. ""We haven't improved much, but we are better organised and we gave fewer balls away."" Hanover's Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti put his side ahead when he hit the top left corner from 16 metres with 28 minutes gone. But the hosts responded with Croatia's Milan Badelj equalising three minutes later before right-wing Maximilian Beister slipped his marker just a minute into the second-half to head home. Beister then turned provider as he found 19-year-old Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu in space and the attacking midfielder fired home for the third six minutes from time. Hanover's Senegal defender Salif Sane was sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card to compound the guests' misery. It was Hanover's eighth match without a win, their sixth straight away defeat, and saw Mirko Slomka's side drop to 13th in the league. Werder Bremen slumped to 12th and their third defeat in four games, as they went down 3-2, despite a late fight back, at home to seventh-placed Mainz 05, for whom Japan's Shinji Okazaki scored twice. On Saturday, Bayern Munich's Germany star Mario Goetze came off the bench to score the opening goal in the European champions' comprehensive 3-0 win at his ex-club Borussia Dortmund. Goetze, who joined Bayern for 37 million euros (US$50m) in July after 12 years at Dortmund, gave the perfect reply to the chorus of boos he received on his return to Borussia's Westfalenstadion. The 21-year-old smashed home a Thomas Mueller pass on 66 minutes, before the floodgates opened and Arjen Robben and Mueller added late goals in the final five minutes. Bayern capped a commanding performance by beating Dortmund for the first time in seven Bundesliga attempts, dating back to February 2010. It was Munich's first win in Dortmund since September 2009. ""We're happy, we won against the best counter-attacking team in the world,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Again, Munich ran out winners in a replay of May's Champions League final as Dortmund had been forced to patch together their entire back four after a spate of injuries. But there can be no excuses as Bayern extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 38 matches and opened a seven-point lead over Dortmund, who drop to third. Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Manchester United by going second with a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin. The win came at a cost as Germany winger Sidney Sam was ruled out of the United clash after tearing a thigh muscle four minutes into the game. Sixth-placed Schalke, who are away to Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Tuesday and are second in Group E behind Chelsea, drew 3-3 at Eintracht Frankfurt. They raced into a 2-0 lead after only 18 minutes but leaked three goals in 12 disastrous second-half minutes. Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes saved Schalke's blushes when he hit the top-right hand corner to equalise with just four minutes left.

Freiburg stay in the relegation places despite their 1-0 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, while Augsburg are up to tenth after their 2-0 win at Hoffenheim. On Friday, Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed fourth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart, their fourth straight win, with goals by Brazil's Raffael and Sweden's Oscar Wendt."

Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp summed up the situation when he said that ""80 percent of my grey hairs were earned this week"", but he has reacted by signing ex-Germany defender Manuel Friedrich, who had been released by Bayer Leverkusen, until the end of the campaign. The 34-year-old is likely to partner Greece international Sokratis Papastathopoulos at centre-back, while youngster Erik Durm is expected to play at left-back with Kevin Grosskreutz on the right. ""We have had to put together a defence which has not yet played 20 games together, but we still have a lot of quality in the squad,"" said Klopp, while sporting director Michael Zorc has defiantly said Dortmund ""won't raise the white flag to anyone"". Even with Bayern's France winger Franck Ribery ruled out with a fractured rib, the pressure is firmly on Dortmund. Their defeat away to Wolfsburg a fortnight ago left them four points adrift, and if they are serious about bringing the Bundesliga trophy back to the Ruhr Valley, this is a match they must win. The difference between the two squads is strength in depth with Guardiola able to call on Germany's Mario Goetze or Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri to fill in for Ribery. ""It's just like it so often is with us: we have a good enough squad and will certainly have a decent team on the pitch, whose goal will be to win there,"" said Bayern's Germany star Thomas Mueller. Goetze, who is returning to Dortmund having left to join Bayern in the summer, will be making his first appearance at the Westfalenstadion in the red shirt. The 21-year-old has said he has ""no fear"" and understands the passionate home supporters would rather see him playing for Borussia, but ex-Dortmund and Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has advised him ""not to take throw-ins or corners"" to stay away from the fans. February 2010 was the last time Bayern beat Dortmund in the Bundesliga, but the Bavarians were victorious when it mattered most, beating the black and yellows in May's Champions League final. Much has been made of Bayern's failure to beat Borussia in their previous six Bundesliga showdowns, but having gone 37 league matches and more than a year without defeat, Munich will be confident of extending their unbeaten Bundesliga run. Certainly, Bayern want to again exert their authority over their rivals, who won back-to-back league titles in 2010/11 and 2011/12 before Bayern swept the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup last season. Among the weekend's other matches, struggling Hamburg host mid-table Hanover without captain Rafael van der Vaart, who tore ankle ligaments while on duty with the Netherlands and is expected to be ruled out for the next four weeks.

176,10/11/2013,19:40,Football: Choupo-Moting strike lifts Mainz,Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting scored a late goal to lift Mainz up to ninth in the Bundesliga on Sunday with a 1-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt.,"The 24-year-old came off the bench to head home at the far post and kick off the party, with carnival season due to begin in Mainz on Monday, by giving Thomas Tuchel's side three points. The result leaves Frankfurt 15th in the league, just above the relegation places after their fourth straight defeat. Later VfB Stuttgart moved up to eighth after picking up their first win in five games with a 3-1 win at Freiburg, who stay in the bottom three. Stuttgart raced into a 2-0 lead with striker Vedad Ibisevic firing home after nine minutes before 17-year-old forward Timo Werner added a second a minute later. Germany striker Mike Hanke pulled a goal back for Freiburg 12 minutes from time before Werner, a Germany Under-19 international, added his second with a superb finish following a strong run. On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich set a new record for the longest unbeaten run in Bundesliga history with a 3-0 victory at home to Augsburg. Bayern have now gone 37 league matches since their last defeat, at Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012, breaking Hamburg's previous record of 36 from January, 1983. Pep Guardiola's Bayern face their biggest test in a fortnight when they travel to second-placed Borussia Dortmund in a repeat of last season's Champions League final. Guardiola also set a personal record as he celebrated his 12th league match without defeat -- with 32 pointsa it's the best start by a new Bundesliga coach in the league's history. The Champions League holders opened the scoring at Munich's Allianz Arena when Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng headed home from a corner after just five minutes. France winger Franck Ribery then smashed home a free-kick on 42 minutes before Germany's Thomas Mueller netted a penalty in the fifth minute of injury time. Bayern, who have won 31 of their last 37 Bundesliga matches, were without Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger, who will miss the forthcoming internationals against Italy and England with an ankle injury. It was Bayern's second milestone of the week after they equalled Barcelona's record from the 2002/03 season of nine consecutive Champions League wins with a 1-0 midweek success at Viktoria Pilsen. Breaking records is nothing remarkable for Bayern these days having set or equalled 25 league markers under Guardiola's predecessor Jupp Heynckes last season. Bayern also extended their lead at the top of the table to four points as second-placed Dortmund went down 2-1 at VfL Wolfsburg. It was Dortmund's second defeat of the week after losing 1-0 at home to Arsenal in the Champions League. After Germany winger Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead with a thunderbolt of a free-kick on the stroke of half-time, Wolves hit back to pick up their fourth straight victory to leave them fifth. Swiss defender Ricardo Rodriguez smashed home a free kick before Croatia striker Ivica Olic hit a great goal in off the far post with 20 minutes left. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are level with Dortmund on 28 points after beating Hamburg 5-3 with South Korea's star striker Son Heung-Min scoring a hat-trick. Son completed his hat-trick within 55 minutes before setting up Stefan Kiessling for Leverkusen's fourth. Borussia Moenchengladbach scored three goals in the last 18 minutes to come from behind and seal a 3-1 win at home to Nuremberg to stay fourth. Schalke 04 bounced back from their Champions League defeat at Chelsea as they came from behind to beat Werder Bremen 3-1, with Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng netting two headers. Hertha Berlin stayed seventh after their 3-2 win at Hoffenheim, with Colombia's Adrian Ramos scoring two goals, including the winner six minutes from time."
177,05/11/2013,19:34,Football: Arsenal to target Dortmund's Lewandowski - Wenger,Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said the Gunners must contain Poland striker Robert Lewandowski in Wednesday's Champions League clash at Borussia Dortmund in their bid to stay top of Group F.,"Lewandowski netted the crucial 82nd-minute goal which sealed Dortmund's impressive 2-1 victory at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium a fortnight ago to throw the group wide open. Having become the first player to score four goals in a Champions League semi-final, Lewandowski warmed up for Arsenal with an 18-minute hat-trick in Friday's 6-1 Bundesliga rout of VfB Stuttgart. ""Usually at home, Lewandowski is quite dangerous and the best way to keep him quiet is by controlling the ball,"" said Wenger. ""We want to control possession and we want to control the game."" With Arsenal, Dortmund and Napoli all level on six points, the Gunners top the table on goal difference and having lost to Dortmund in London, Wenger's side is desperate to win the return. ""We definitely want to win after losing at home,"" said Wenger. ""Dortmund is a very positive side, so at least you have a guarantee that both teams will be trying to win the game."" In the build-up to the match, Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, a heavy metal-fan, described Wenger as having organised Arsenal into a finely-tuned ""orchestra"" and the Frenchman continued the musical analogy. ""I am not a music specialist, but Dortmund are a very good team, so we should see a good symphony,"" quipped Wenger. The showdown at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion promises to be a high-quality confrontation between the Premier League leaders and Borussia, who are second only to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. Dortmund bounced back from their opening 2-1 defeat at Napoli with a 3-0 home win over Marseille before beating Arsenal in London, but Germany winger Marco Reus said Borussia can take nothing for granted. ""We have improved since Napoli, but you can't compare this to the (German) league, this is the Champions League and the smallest mistake will be punished,"" said Reus. ""It will be another 50-50 match, I believe we produced a great performance in London and will have to do so again."" According to Klopp, Germany centre-back Mats Hummels is ""97.5 percent"" sure to miss the game with back and thigh injuries. Left-back Marcel Schmelzer could feature having played 70 minutes of the Stuttgart victory after struggling with a hamstring injury."
178,05/11/2013,02:10,"Football: Atletico look to seal knockout spot, English duo to beat German rivals",Atletico Madrid's stunning form domestically and in Europe can earn its first reward on Wednesday with a place in the Last 16 of the Champions League if they beat Austria Vienna in Madrid.,"Elsewhere both Premier League leaders Arsenal and rivals Chelsea will be seeking to secure wins over last season's beaten finalists Borussia Dortmund and fellow Bundesliga outfit Schalke 04 respectively. Group E Chelsea (ENG) v Schalke 04 (GER) Chelsea host Schalke smarting from their shock 2-0 defeat at Newcastle at the weekend, a defeat that could lead Blues boss Jose Mourinho to tinker with his line-up. After an opening loss to Basel Chelsea have got into their European stride, with impressive wins against Steaua Bucharest and at Schalke last time out. ""We are in a stable position to qualify in the Champions League but if we lose again we are in a difficult position,"" Mourinho warned. Schalke, sharing top spot with Chelsea on six points, travel to Stamford Bridge on the back of a 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga. Basel (SUI) v Steaua Bucharest (ROM) Basel came away from Bucharest with a disappointing draw a fortnight ago which left them in third and on target for a post-Christmas ticket to the Europa League. After upsetting Chelsea in their first group game though they will be anxious to bag all the points here to keep them in the running for a place in the knockout stages. Group F Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Arsenal (ENG) Dortmund ruined Arsene Wenger's 64th birthday celebrations with a 2-1 win at the Emirates a fortnight ago. Dortmund 'keeper Roman Weidenfeller is wary of a reaction, saying: ""We have irritated them with our win in London. Now they want to strike back."" The Bundesliga outfit could not be in better shape, meting out a 6-1 drubbing to Vfb Stuttgart last Friday. Arsenal, second on goal difference to Dortmund, make the trip in good heart themselves having seen off Liverpool 2-0 to pull five points clear in the Premier League. Wenger said: ""We go to Dortmund now and we were very disappointed with how we lost to them. It was a very sloppy goal when we were in control but we got a good result in Germany last season against Bayern Munich. So we have been there before and are used to the atmosphere over there and hopefully we can get a good result."" Napoli (ITA) v Marseille (FRA) Rafael Benitez's Napoli are on a three-match winning run in Serie A, and host Marseille after a 2-1 win at the Velodrome on matchday three. That's left the Italians bang in contention for a place in the knockout round, level on six points with Dortmund and Arsenal, while for pointless Marseille, who ended a five match losing run in Ligue 1 on Saturday, it's a case of win or bust. The Italians are without right back Giandomenico Mesto, who underwent knee surgery on Monday. Group G Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) v FC Porto (POR) Zenit can steal a march on Porto for the runners-up spot by beating them on Wednesday and open up a four point gap with two games remaining. The Russian side made heavy weather of beating Porto in their match a fortnight ago as the hosts played most of the match with only 10 men. Zenit, though, go into the game having seen their eight match winning streak ended at the weekend with a 1-1 draw by Amkar Perm. Porto too were held to a surprise draw, 1-1 away at unheralded Belenenses. Porto boast a good away record away against Russian sides, winning four and losing one, while Zenit have never lost at home to Portuguese clubs in five matches. Atletico Madrid (ESP) v Austria Vienna (AUT) Atletico have made light work of a weak group and can seal their place in the Last 16 -- for the first time since the 2008/09 campaign -- with victory over an Austrian team they outclassed last month in a 3-0 win. A win for Atletico would also set a new club record of four successive wins in European club football's premier competition, beating the three in the 1958/59 season. Atletico warmed up for the game with a comfortable 2-0 win at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday for their 11th win in 12 La Liga games. Coach Diego Simeone will be looking to his Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa to inflict more pain on their opponents after he scored a double against them in the first match. ""It's not just his goals, in his participation in the play and the connection he has with the other players he makes the team better,"" purred Simeone of his leading scorer, who has more than made up for the sale of Falcao in the close season. Group H Ajax (NED) v Celtic (SCO) Ajax need at least a point from this game if they are not to be in serious danger of missing out even on third spot and a place in the Europa League. Celtic by contrast will be seeking a repeat of the win they grabbed against the Dutch side last month which reignited hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages for the second successive season. Ajax have made their worst ever start to a CL campaign while Celtic are bidding to avoid a third successive away defeat. Celtic manager Neil Lennon says that he wants his players to take their chances otherwise it could prove very costly. His Ajax counterpart, though, Frank de Boer believes that if his young team repeat the performance they produced against Celtic in the first game they will take the points. ""If we play like that again in two weeks, then we will beat them in the Amsterdam ArenA. I really believe in that."" Barcelona (ESP) v AC Milan (ITA) Barcelona can all but seal their place in the Last 16 with victory at home to a woefully out of sorts and injury-hit Milan side. Barcelona's worries are small by comparison to the Italians, who have made their worst start to a Serie A season in over 20 years, their loss to Fiorentina at the weekend their fifth of the season already. However, coach Massimiliano Allegri appears to be benefiting from some unaccustomed patience from the club directors who have called for no one to panic. However defeat in Barcelona and a Celtic win would really heap pressure on them in the chase for the second spot. The Scottish side are yet to host them and will fancy their chances of avenging an unfortunate defeat at the San Siro."

Hamburg captain Rafael van der Vaart earned his side a point when he equalised for the third time for the hosts on 67 minutes on Van Marwijk's home debut. Stuttgart spent the last six minutes with 10 men after Germany Under-21 centre-back Antonio Ruediger was shown a straight red for hitting Dutch midfielder Van der Vaart in the ribs. ""We have improved again and are playing football the way I like it,"" said Van Marwijk as Hamburg rallied at 3-2 down after ex-Arsenal defender Johan Djourou conceded a second-half own goal. ""We had a couple of really nice attacks, which pleased me. We had a bit of bad luck with the own goal."" After a draw at Frankfurt and a 5-0 hammering of Nuremberg, the point kept Hamburg 15th, having been in the bottom three when Van Marwijk took over, while Stuttgart are eighth. Wolfsburg moved up to ninth with a 2-1 win at Augsburg with Wolves ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Luiz Gustavo heading the first-half winner. On Saturday, European champions Bayern extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 34 games by coming from behind for a 4-1 home win over Mainz to go back to the top. Having last lost in the German league back in October 2012, Bayern are now just two matches short of equalling Hamburg's 30-year-old, 36-match streak. Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng. But Bayern roared back when Germany midfielder Mario Goetze came off the bench for the second-half and played a key part in the hosts' first three second-half goals.

And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time.

And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time to make it 4-1. ""We were like a 1970s VW Beetle and you can't dream of winning a race against a Formula One car,"" admitted Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel. Bayern's win put them back on top of the Bundesliga after Bayer Leverkusen had briefly gone top on Friday thanks to a controversial 'phantom' goal in their 2-1 win at Hoffenheim. The German Football Federation (DFB) are set to investigate while Hoffenheim have called for a replay after Stefan Kiessling's 70th-minute winner came in bizarre circumstances. Replays showed his header only ended in the back of the net after flying through a hole in the side netting and a DFB sports court is set to meet on Monday. Hertha Berlin went fourth after their 1-0 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach with Colombia's Adrian Ramos scoring the winner in the capital with a first-half header. Schalke, who host Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday, needed a 91st-minute winner from Roman Neustaedter to seal a 3-2 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Having only picked up their first win of the season a fortnight ago against Wolfsburg, Braunschweig gave Schalke an almighty scare before Germany's Neustaedter hit the winner. Borussia Dortmund, who are at Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, stayed second with a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96. Germany winger Marco Reus hit the winning penalty after just four minutes when Hanover's Japan defender Hiroki Sakai fouled left-back Erik Durm in the area. Sakai was shown a yellow card for the foul and Reus blasted home the spot kick as Dortmund picked up the three points. ""I am happy with the result, we knew it would be difficult,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""We started well, but then got weaker, but for me it was decisive that the lads dealt with the situation. ""We can play better football and we will."" Borussia stay second and level on 22 points with third-placed Leverkusen, just a point behind Bayern. Second-from-bottom Freiburg picked up a point with a goalless draw at Werder Bremen, while Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 at home to Nuremberg. On Sunday, Hamburg host VfB Stuttgart and Augsburg are home to Wolfsburg."

Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng.

""It's great to get the hat-trick, but it's more important that things went so well for the team,"" said Lasogga, who claimed the fastest away hat-trick in Bundesliga history. This was only the second game for Van Marwijk, 61, who coached Holland to the 2010 World Cup final. He replaced Thorsten Fink last month after a disastrous start left Hamburg in the relegation places. The Dutchman has promised to tighten Hamburg's defence, but it was their attack which ran riot at Nuremberg. ""I like attacking football, although tactical discipline belongs to that and we still lose the ball too often, but it's getting better,"" said Van Marwijk, whose reign opened with a draw at Frankfurt last week. ""A 5-0 win doesn't happen every week, but it's important to help the self-confidence come back."" Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opened the scoring with a superb scissor-kick volley on 17 minutes. The Hamburg captain then provided the final passes for Lasogga to fire home his first two goals while the ex-Hertha Berlin forward completed the hat-trick when he pounced on a loose ball and smashed his shot inside the inside post. Midfielder Tolgay Arslan bagged the fifth 16 minutes from time to leave Nuremberg reeling. The rout lifts Hamburg up to 14th, while Nuremberg slip into the bottom three. On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich went top for the first time under Pep Guardiola after a 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen.

In a high-tempo clash at Leverkusen's BayArena, Germany midfielder Sidney Sam's 31st-minute equaliser for the hosts cancelled out Toni Kroos' opening goal for Bayern. Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno guaranteed a point for his side by denying Franck Ribery twice in as many second-half minutes, then Mario Goetze, while Thomas Mueller had a penalty appeal turned down. But Guardiola was a picture of frustration, brooding on the Bayern bench and drumming his fingers as Bayern enjoyed 27 shots on goal and 78 percent possession, but managed just a single goal. The point was enough to send Bayern top, with Leverkusen third, behind Borussia Dortmund. Fresh from their impressive 3-0 Champions League win over Marseille, Dortmund were set to claim an away point until a disastrous final 10-minute spell, triggered by Mats Hummels' red card. The Germany defender was sent off on 81 minutes after a reckless challenge on 'Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit in the area. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the resulting penalty, then Brazilian forward Raffael hit their second four minutes from time to see 'Gladbach move up to fourth. Schalke 04 came from behind to claim a 4-1 win over 10-man Augsburg in Gelsenkirchen to move up to eighth. VfB Stuttgart dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Hoffenheim stayed 10th with a 2-2 draw at Mainz. Eintracht Braunschweig, who have been bottom of the table since last season's promotion, picked up their first win of the season with a shock 2-0 victory at VfL Wolfsburg -- their first Bundesliga victory since 1985.

Bayern needed an hour to break the deadlock as Germany star Thomas Mueller netted his first Bundesliga goal of the season when he met Franck Ribery's pass from the left wing at the far post. Bayer Leverkusen stayed third, just a point behind Dortmund and Bayern, with a 2-0 win at home to Hanover 96 as Germany midfielders Simon Rolfes and Sidney Sam scored first-half goals.

""We're improving from game to game and we will get better from week to week,"" said centre-back Boateng whose Bayern side host Hanover 96 in the second round of the German Cup on Wednesday. It was Schalke's worst home league defeat since May, 1981. Guardiola, who took charge of the European champions in June, hailed Bayern's display.

Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp brought a weakened team with centre-back Mats Hummels missing with a back injury. Star striker Robert Lewandowski and midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan started on the bench and were rested after Borussia's 2-1 Champions League defeat at Napoli on Wednesday. Both Schmelzer and attacking midfielder Marco Reus are doubtful for Tuesday's German Cup second-round match at second division 1860 Munich after picking up leg injuries.

Hanover 96 stay fourth after a 2-1 win at home to Ausgburg with Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti netting an 89th-minute penalty. After sacking coach Thorsten Fink last week in the wake of their 6-2 drubbing at Dortmund, Hamburg slumped to their fourth defeat of the season, losing 2-0 at home to neighbours Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg moved up to sixth with a 2-1 win at home to Hoffenheim as Croatia's ex-Bayern striker Ivica Olic scored both Wolves goals. On Sunday, VfB Stuttgart drew 1-1 with Eintracht Frankfurt, a result which left both teams in mid-table. Stuttgart striker Vedad Ibisevic missed two clear chances including a 93rd-minute penalty. After successive defeats, Hertha Berlin picked up their first point in three games with a 1-1 draw at Freiburg.

It was especially satisfying as Dutch winger Arjen Robben played a big part in both goals as Bayern enjoyed around 70 percent ball possession. Hanover, who last won in Munich seven years ago, squandered a chance when Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan hit the crossbar in the first half and the result sees them slip down to fourth. Bayer Leverkusen, who launch their Champions League campaign at English giants Manchester United on Tuesday, warmed up for their Old Trafford clash with a convincing 3-1 win over 10-man VfL Wolfsburg to stay third. Germany winger Sidney Sam put the hosts ahead before Wolfsburg's Croatia striker Ivica Olic levelled just before the break. Bayer striker Stefan Kiessling netted twice to give Leverkusen their fourth win from their opening five games, heading home on 65 minutes before slamming in his second in added time. Wolves were reduced to ten men when ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off in the final 10 minutes, for the second time this season for a second yellow card. The Brazilian had only just returned from suspension after being dismissed in the 2-0 defeat at Mainz at the end of August. Schalke 04, who host Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Wednesday, continued their revival by picking up their second victory as new signing Kevin-Prince Boateng hit the first-half winner in only his second league match since arriving from AC Milan. The victory lifts the Royal Blues up to eighth, while Mainz are fifth. Werder Bremen crashed to their third consecutive defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt, with Czech Republic striker Vaclav Kadlec scoring two first-half goals before Austria defender Sebastian Proedl scored a late own-goal to complete Bremen's misery. Augsburg needed a 90th-minute winner from midfielder Tobias Werner to seal a 2-1 win at home to Freiburg while on Friday VfB Stuttgart earned a 1-0 win in the capital against Hertha Berlin, picking up their second win under caretaker coach Thomas Schneider."
205,01/09/2013,20:20,Football: Mkhitaryan fires Dortmund top of Bundesliga,Borussia Dortmund knocked Bayern Munich off top spot in the Bundesliga on Sunday as new signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored both goals in their 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt.,"The 24-year-old attacking midfielder proved why Dortmund paid Shakhtar Donetsk 27.5 million euros ($36.3m) for him with his first two league goals in only his third Bundesliga appearance. It means Dortmund go into the international break for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers two points clear of European champions Bayern. Mkhitaryan started off by finishing a defence-splitting pass from Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski after ten minutes. Frankfurt equalised when Stefan Aigner's bullet-header slammed off the post and Czech striker Vaclav Kadlec rifled home the rebound on 36 minutes for his first Bundesliga goal, having joined from Sparta Prague last month. But Mkhitaryan restored Dortmund's lead with the winner when he dribbled along the edge of the area and unleashed a fearsome shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. However, the Armenian said Dortmund must improve to keep Bayern in second. ""I feel good in Dortmund and I'm happy with the goals, but I think we need to be much better,"" insisted Mkhitaryan, while Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp described the midfielder as ""a weapon in front of goal with an awesome shooting technique"". The result means Dortmund finish the weekend as the league's only team with a 100 percent record as Bayern, who drew 1-1 with Freiburg on Tuesday, Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen all dropped points. Earlier, VfB Stuttgart romped to a 6-2 Bundesliga win over Hoffenheim with striker Vedad Ibisevic netting a hat-trick after coach Bruno Labbadia was sacked last Monday. Stuttgart picked up their first points of the season after three straight defeats led to Labbadia's dismissal. Caretaker coach Thomas Schneider got off to an emphatic start as Stuttgart's Romanian striker Alexandru Maxim did the damage by scoring two goals and setting up two more, while Bosnia striker Ibisevic claimed a hat-trick. The result lifts Stuttgart out of the bottom three and into 14th and leaves Hoffenheim 11th after their first defeat of the season. On Saturday, Leverkusen blew the chance to go top with a 2-0 defeat at resurgent Schalke 04. Both Germany left-back Dennis Aogo, who has joined Schalke on loan from Hamburg, and Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who signed a four-year deal after arriving from AC Milan on Friday, started as the Royal Blues picked up their first league win of the season. Schalke went ahead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area. Mainz 05 also wasted their opportunity to go top as they crashed to a 4-1 defeat at Hanover 96. Mainz took a 12th-minute lead through striker Nicolai Mueller, but Senegal striker Mame Diouf and Poland forward Artur Sobiech put the hosts 2-1 up at the break before Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan and midfielder Edgar Prib increased the lead. Elsewhere, struggling Hamburg picked up their first win of the season after two consecutive defeats with a 4-0 thumping of promoted Eintracht Braunschweig. Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart put Hamburg ahead in the seventh minute on their first attack before Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua doubled the lead on 17 minutes as the hosts counter-attacked at pace. Hamburg made sure of the three points -- and Braunschweig's fourth straight defeat to leave Eintracht bottom of the table -- when 19-year-old Turkish midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu came on for Van der Vaart on 79 minutes to claim a brace, including a stunning free-kick. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach moved up to seventh as they romped to a 4-1 home win over Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin with Ivica Olic and Diego on target, while Augsburg picked up their second straight win with a 1-0 success at Nuremberg thanks to a late goal from substitute Kevin Vogt."

""It was a fun game for us, we gave it our all after a tough week,"" said Ibisevic, who was sporting a black-eye after receiving a stray boot in the face late on. ""That was a reaction from the events of the last few weeks."" The result lifts Stuttgart out of the bottom three and into 14th and leaves Hoffenheim 11th after their first defeat of the season. Borussia Dortmund can usurp defending champions Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table if they win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday evening.

In the battle between the Bundesliga's other two Champions League representatives, Schalke hauled themselves up into mid-table and left Leverkusen joint-third behind Bayern and second-placed Dortmund, who are at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday.

That makes me proud,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. ""We implemented everything we had planned. Both Kevin-Prince Boateng and Dennis Aogo did really well on their debuts."" Schalke recovered from losing their opening two Bundesliga games against Wolfsburg and Hanover 96 to qualify for the Champions League group stage at the expense of Greek club PAOK on Tuesday and built on that success with what was a convincing home league win against Leverkusen.

Having cost Bayern 37 million euros (US$49.2m), Goetze is another top name coach Pep Guardiola needs to accomodate in his star-studded midfield. Goetze is an option alongside Spain Under-21 captain Thiago Alcantara in an attacking midfield role, flanked by France winger Franck Ribery and Germany's Thomas Mueller, leaving Dutchman Robben on the bench. The 29-year-old, who scored Bayern's winning goal in May's Champions League final against Dortmund, only returned to the starting line-up last season after injury to Toni Kroos, but the he said competition for places is a healthy thing in the Bayern ranks. ""It was our strength last season that we never lost our quality, even when players dropped out with injury,"" Robben told German daily Bild.

Germany striker Stefan Kiessling put the hosts ahead with 22 minutes gone, but Freiburg's new signing Mike Hanke levelled just before the break. Son restored Leverkusen's lead just two minutes into the second half when he fired home from close range after a final pass from Sidney Sam. Germany midfielder Sam then converted Kiessling's cross to seal the win with 52 minutes gone, while Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno protected his side's lead when he saved a 67th minute penalty from Jonathan Schmid. Hertha Berlin marked their return to the top-flight after a year's absence with a stunning 6-1 rout of Eintracht Frankfurt. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos and Tunisia forward Sami Allagui each scored twice in the hammering at Berlin's Olympic Stadium while a first-half penalty from Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Alex Meier was all the guests could muster. Hanover 96 enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg, who finished with nine men after both midfielder Maximilian Arnold and Swiss defender Timm Klose were sent off. Hoffenheim were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Nuremberg while Werder Bremen edged newly-promoted Eintracht Braunschweig 1-0 with Austria midfielder Zlatko Junuzovic hitting the 82-minute winner."
